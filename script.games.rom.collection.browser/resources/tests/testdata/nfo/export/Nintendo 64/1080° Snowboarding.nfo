  <plot>Youâre taking a Tahoe 155 snowboard down a steep, bumpy incline at night and youâre about to top off an Indy Nosebone with a 360Â° Air, and you havenât even left your living room!  Youâre Playing 1080Â° (Ten Eighty) Snowboarding, a game so intense youâll be brushing the snow off your goggles.  With five different boarders, eight different Lamar snowboards, more than 25 tricks, a Half-Pipe and six different courses, this is as close as youâll get to the real thing without hopping on the next ski lift.

â¢ Six game modes and courses!
â¢ 2-Player simultaneous play!
â¢ Over 25 different tricks!
â¢ Compatible with Rumble Pak accessory.</plot>
