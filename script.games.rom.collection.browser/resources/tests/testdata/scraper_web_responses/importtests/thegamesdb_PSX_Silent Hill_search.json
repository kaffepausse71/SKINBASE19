The first in a series about a mysterious town of the same name, Silent Hill generated a direct sequel, three indirect sequels, a prequel and a film adaptation. The game was included in Sony's Greatest Hits and Platinum Range of budget titles as a result of strong sales. A reinterpretation of the game was developed for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable.\r\nThe plot focuses on Harry Mason as he searches for his daughter, Cheryl, who has disappeared following a car accident which left Harry unconscious. He finds Silent Hill to be largely abandoned, shrouded in a thick fog, snowing out of season, filled with monsters and being over taken by a hellish otherworld. As Harry scours the town, he begins learning about the history of Silent Hill and stumbles upon a cult ritual undertaken to bring a god to Earth.","rating":"M - Mature","developers":[4765,10302],"genres":[1,18],"publishers":[140]}]},"include":{"boxart":{"base_url":{"original":"https:\/\/cdn.thegamesdb.net\/images\/original\/","small":"https:\/\/cdn.thegamesdb.net\/images\/small\/","thumb":"https:\/\/cdn.thegamesdb.net\/images\/thumb\/","cropped_center_thumb":"https:\/\/cdn.thegamesdb.net\/images\/cropped_center_thumb\/","medium":"https:\/\/cdn.thegamesdb.net\/images\/medium\/","large":"https:\/\/cdn.thegamesdb.net\/images\/large\/"},"data":{"1014":[{"id":2541,"type":"boxart","side":"front","filename":"boxart\/front\/1014-1.jpg","resolution":"650x650"},{"id":36495,"type":"boxart","side":"back","filename":"boxart\/back\/1014-1.jpg","resolution":"1617x1393"}]}}},"pages":{"previous":null,"current":"https:\/\/api.thegamesdb.net\/v1\/Games\/ByGameName?filter%5Bplatform%5D=10&apikey=1e821bf1bab06854840650d77e7e2248f49583821ff9191f2cced47e43bf0a73&include=boxart&name=Silent+Hill&fields=id%2Cgame_title%2Crelease_date%2Cdevelopers%2Cpublishers%2Cplayers%2Cgenres%2Coverview%2Crating&page=1","next":null},"remaining_monthly_allowance":2972,"extra_allowance":0,"allowance_refresh_timer":2366651}
