"description": "<h2>History</h2><p>In 1987 a small and struggling video game company called <a href=\"/square-co-ltd/3010-6323/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6323\">Square</a> put all their remaining resources entirely into the hands of the Director of Planning and Development named <a href=\"/hironobu-sakaguchi/3040-633/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-633\">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a>. They earnestly hoped that whatever game he made would be a hit. As Hironobu was convinced this would be his last game ever, he called it Final Fantasy.</p><h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/469148-final_fantasy_nes_screenshot1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-469148\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/469148-final_fantasy_nes_screenshot1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-469148\"><img alt=\" Opening text. \" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/469148-final_fantasy_nes_screenshot1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/469148-final_fantasy_nes_screenshot1.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption> Opening text. </figcaption></figure><p>Final Fantasy is a single player role-playing game (RPG) which lets the player control four characters called the \"Light Warriors.\" They begin by rescuing a princess from the Notorious Knight <a href=\"/garland/3005-3158/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3158\">Garland</a>. Soon after, they are given the world spanning task of collecting four Orbs of Light and defeating four fiends. The fiends went by the names of Lich, Kary, Kraken, and Tiamat. They had taken the Orbs from the rightful place they belonged and spread corruption over all the lands, skies, and seas. After many battles the Light warriors had collected items, gold and experience. When all the fiends were defeated, it was revealed that they took Garland’s corpse and sent it back in time. He had now become a mass of living evil known as Chaos. Confusingly Chaos sent the four fiends into the future where they currently plagued the world. Only when Chaos was defeated in the past and the four fiends were defeated in the present, was the world's natural balance finally restored.</p><p>Final Fantasy was originally considered overbearingly difficult. Saves only came at resting in a Town’s Inn or using an expensive item known as a House. Spells in the late game cost more than half a million gil, and had a limited number of charges that could only be replenished by resting. Monster encounters could go from simplistic to overpowering at a moment’s notice.</p><h2>Battle System</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338481\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 544px\" data-ratio=\"0.77941176470588\" data-width=\"544\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338481\"><img alt=\" Fighting wolves in the MSX version.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif 544w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Fighting wolves in the MSX version.</figcaption></figure><p>Attacks were played out in turn based combat. All characters and monsters all were told what to do before the round began, be it cast a spell, use an item, or commit a basic attack, and all actions were then played out from the fastest person on the battlefield to the slowest. In the original game, some attacks could be useless. For example, if a Fighter and a Thief were both instructed to attack a goblin they would both do so. If the Thief killed him, it wouldn't stop the fighter from doing exactly as he was told by swinging his sword at the space the goblin once stood instead of at the other enemies present. This was later altered in the re-releases for the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PSOne</a>, <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a>, and <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iPhone</a> versions, so the attacker would automatically attack the next available target.</p><h2>Innovation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/469132-ffscreenie3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-469132\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/469132-ffscreenie3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-469132\"><img alt=\" Crafting a party from six available classes.

These classes could be upgraded by the Dragon King, to; White Wizard, Black Wizard, Red Wizard, Ninja, Knight, and Master. Players traveled the world in vehicles, such as; boats, airships, and canoes. In combat, up to 9 monsters of various types could battle the player's party. Unless they soared through the skies in an airship or strolled in a safe area like a town, 'random encounters' were always possible. In these Encounters, a band of monsters could emerge and strike the party. Mages had a limited amount of spells they could learn.</p><p>Final Fantasy had almost 20 musical tracks. Some of which, like the tune played after 'Victorious battle' and the 'Opening Theme', remained in one form or another in Final Fantasy games for decades to come.</p><h2>Music</h2><p>The music for Final Fantasy was composed by <a href=\"/nobuo-uematsu/3040-635/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-635\">Nobuo Uematsu</a>. Some of the tracks became the trademarks to the Final Fantasy series: like the \"Prelude\", played on the title screen, and the \"Victory Fanfare\", which is played after every victorious battle.</p><h2>Version Differences</h2><h3>Wonderswan and PlayStation</h3><p>The <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PSOne</a> release of Final Fantasy was under the title of <a href=\"/final-fantasy-origins/3030-7866/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7866\">Final Fantasy Origins</a> and contained enhanced remakes of both Final Fantasy I and II using higher quality MIDI and cleaner 16-bit graphics. These enhanced remakes were initially ports of the <a href=\"/wonderswan/3045-65/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-65\">Wonderswan</a> re-releases that never made it to the US for various reasons, most notably because the <a href=\"/wonderswan-color/3045-54/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-54\">Wonderswan Color</a> was never released in the US. Aside from the obvious graphical face-lift, various changes exist in the PSOne version that differ from the original NES version. An easy mode was created for the original Final Fantasy (increased Gil and EXP curves), auto-re-targeting, a temporary quicksave, and the addition of new items such as <a href=\"/phoenix-down/3055-1009/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1009\">Phoenix Downs</a> (revive a fallen ally) and Gold Needles (remove petrification).</p><h3>Game Boy Advance</h3><p>Using the same enhanced graphical look of the PSOne release, the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Gameboy Advance</a> release of Final Fantasy, known as <a href=\"/final-fantasy-i-ii-dawn-of-souls/3030-17928/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17928\">Dawn of Souls</a>, was most notable for drastically reducing the difficulty. The version also included bonus dungeons for each game, though the complex battle transitions and music quality were reduced due to the technical limitations of the system. All changes to the battle system of the PSOne release carry over, however the magic system (previously levels of magic \"slots\" with limited number of uses) was changed to use Magic Points instead. Speculative reasons for the changes include Nintendo's fear that an overly difficult RPG would turn away the younger player-base, arguably a larger portion of the overall audience than on the PSOne.</p><h3>PSP</h3><p>The <a href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a> re-release featured the same difficulty reduction and added bonus dungeons of the Gameboy Advance re-release, but featured an even bigger graphical overhaul, with various post-processing effects added such as cloud overcast and hi-res sprites (including spells). However, unlike Origins and Dawn of Souls, these two versions were not sold together and retailed individually at release for $29.99 USD each. Together, these two releases doubled the price of the initial release of both Final Fantasy Origins and Dawn of Souls ($29.99). The price, in addition to the numerous other re-releases of the games on other platforms, resulted in the game receiving much criticism from the gaming press.</p><h3>iPhone</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294180\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294180\"><img alt=\" Giant D-Pad\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Giant D-Pad\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Giant D-Pad</figcaption></figure><p>On February 25, 2010, Square-Enix released an updated version of this game onto the <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iPhone</a> and iPod Touch. Retailing for $8.99, it is essentially a port of the PSP version of the game. The graphics are higher resolution than the Dawn of Souls remake, and are essentially on-par with the sprites seen in the PSP version. In addition, the Soul of Chaos, Labyrinth of Time, and the 4 special element-based dungeons are also included (which are unlocked after defeating one of the four Elemental Masters). The game immediately rocketed up to the #2 spot on the Top Grossing Apps list.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294185\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294185\"><img alt=\" Big Buttons for easy pressingness\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Big Buttons for easy pressingness\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Big Buttons for easy pressingness</figcaption></figure><p>The game has a specialized control scheme for the touch screen.

This is a highly efficient method for playing the game, but whereas in other games the player could just hold a button down to skip past the battles, it requires continued taps in this version, which can actually slow down the game. It currently sits around 4.5 stars on iTunes.</p>",

"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Developed by <a href=\"/matrix-software/3010-3256/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3256\">Matrix Software</a>, the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">DS</a> remake of Final Fantasy III is based on the <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iii/3030-21463/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21463\">original 1990 game</a> for the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> that was never released outside of Japan. Though the basic flow of events remains the same as that of the original version, the storyline has been rewritten to account for four all-new protagonists; <a href=\"/luneth/3005-3452/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3452\">Luneth</a>, <a href=\"/ingus/3005-3455/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3455\">Ingus</a>, <a href=\"/arc/3005-3454/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3454\">Arc</a>, and <a href=\"/refia/3005-3453/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3453\">Refia</a>. In the original version of Final Fantasy III, the player characters were four children with no unique backgrounds or personalities. This version of Final Fantasy III was later ported to <a href=\"/android/3045-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-123\">Android</a> and <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS</a> devices, as well as the <a href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP </a>and <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>.</p><h2>New Features</h2><p>The remake of Final Fantasy III features a number of changes and additions that weren't present in the original version. These changes include:</p><h3>New Starting Class</h3><p>In the original version of Final Fantasy III, the default starting class for the four party members was \"Onion Knight.\" In the remake, Onion Knight has been remade as a special unlockable class. As a result, the starting class is a new class called \"Freelancer.\"</p><h3>Secret Dungeon</h3><p>An optional dungeon can be found in an underwater region after meeting the prerequisites. Inside this dungeon is an optional boss, the Iron Giant, which is more powerful and difficult to face than the game's final boss, Cloud of Darkness.</p><h3>Wi-Fi Support</h3><p>Players may send messages to one another over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection by using the in-game Mognet service. Characters within the game will also periodically send messages to the player. Sending and receiving messages to and from other players is part of the process that unlocks the Onion Knight class, as well as the secret bonus dungeon.</p><h2>Classes</h2><p>The full list of classes available in the DS version of Final Fantasy III Is as follows:</p><ul><li>Freelancer</li><li>Warrior</li><li>Monk</li><li>Black Mage</li><li>White Mage</li><li>Red Mage</li><li>Thief</li><li>Ranger</li><li>Knight</li><li>Scholar</li><li>Geomancer</li><li>Viking</li><li>Dragoon</li><li>Dark Knight</li><li>Evoker</li><li>Bard</li><li>Black Belt</li><li>Magus</li><li>Devout</li><li>Summoner</li><li>Sage</li><li>Ninja</li><li>Onion Knight</li></ul><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows Vista, 7, 8</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Pentium 4, 2.4 GHz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM</li><li><strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 800 MB available space</li></ul>",

"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy (also known as Dissidia Duodecim) is the prequel/sequel to the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21202\" href=\"/dissidia-final-fantasy/3030-21202/\">Dissidia: Final Fantasy</a>. Like the original game, Duodecim is a crossover fighting game that pits major characters from throughout the primary <a data-ref-id=\"3025-194\" href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194/\">Final Fantasy</a> series against each other. It was released on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-18\" href=\"/psp/3045-18/\">PSP</a> in Japan March 3rd, 2011, March 22nd, 2011 in North America and March 25th, 2011 in Europe.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay remains mostly the same from the original Dissidia (details can be found <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21202\" href=\"/dissidia-final-fantasy/3030-21202/\">here</a>), with a few new mechanics and improvements. The original's destiny board and DP-based overworld has been overhauled in favor of a robust world map, gateways, and the introduction of a new currency KP, kupo points. Earned by completing certain victory conditions, which vary depending on the gateway, KP is used to acquire rare weapons, armor, accessories, and summons not available for purchase with <a data-ref-id=\"3055-190\" href=\"/gil/3055-190/\">gil</a> in the main shop. In the story mode, some gateways will have level caps for KP - if the player enters with a character lower than the cap, bonus KP will be awarded based on the difference in levels. However, if the player enters with a character at the cap, no bonus KP is awarded and if the character enters with a higher level, the gateway is started with negative KP. For this reason, it is possible to adjust every character's level accordingly (up until their most current level, no higher). Experience gained while the level is adjusted will still be awarded, however, until the level is readjusted to the most current and highest level available, the character will remain at the adjusted level.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/113828/1835886-adjust_level.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1835886\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/113828/1835886-adjust_level.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1835886\"><img alt=\"You can adjust individual levels to maximize KP bonuses.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/113828/1835886-adjust_level.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/113828/1835886-adjust_level.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>You can adjust individual levels to maximize KP bonuses.</figcaption></figure><p>The combat system also received a few changes - in addition to the EX bar used for limit breaks, there is now an Assist bar to summon an assist character for attacks. The assist bar fills whenever an attack is performed, regardless of whether it connects or not. At the first level of the bar, summoning an assist will have that character perform a bravery attack. At the max level of the assist bar, the assisting character will perform an HP attack. Assist characters can also be attacked during this animation and if attacked, the assist bar will lock, preventing tag-ins for a brief period of time. The assist characters can also stop a combo if being attacked while activating, but this also causes the bar to lock temporarily.</p><p>Added to the EX bar functionality is \"EX Revenge,\" performed while being attacked and activating EX Mode. Doing so will slow down your opponent dramatically for a period of time or if the player lands an HP attack.</p><p>It is also now possible to fight with parties. The battles are still one-on-one, but depending on the size of the enemy party, one battle can turn into a series of separate battles. If the first member of the party falls, it goes to the next party member and so on and so forth until the enemy party is defeated. All characters in the party gain the same amount of experience (assist characters do not gain experience, however) but if a character falls in battle, he/she is KOed for the duration of the gateway (in story mode) or for the rest of the battle (in aracade mode).</p><p>There are two full campaigns - one explaining the events of Duodecim, the war between Chaos and Cosmos before the events of the original game and containing the new characters and the other basically rehashing the original game with the original cast, except with the new gameplay mechanics in place. Additionally, there is also an arcade mode, a card-based battle mode, and \"Reports,\" which fill in some missing gaps between the main story campaigns. Sometimes, the Reports involve battles.</p><h2>Roster</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/96326/1522509-dissidia012_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1522509\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/96326/1522509-dissidia012_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1522509\"><img alt=\"Final Fantasy XIII's Lightning joins the roster in Duodecim.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/96326/1522509-dissidia012_001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/96326/1522509-dissidia012_001.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/96326/1522509-dissidia012_001.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy XIII's Lightning joins the roster in Duodecim.</figcaption></figure><p>The full roster includes all of the playable characters found in the Original Dissidia along with 9 new combatants.

It was released on the Super Famicom on April 2, 1994. Six months later, on October 11, 1994, it was released as Final Fantasy III on the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> in North America. Final Fantasy VI was later rereleased on the Sony <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation</a> (its first European release) and <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>. The Playstation versions added <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">load time pauses before each battle</a>, but it is still a good game despite this flaw. Both of these rereleases were developed by <a href=\"/tose-co-ltd/3010-1417/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1417\">TOSE</a> and published by various publishers.</p><p>Final Fantasy VI is generally considered by fans and critics alike to be one of the best console role-playing games (it has a 94% rating on GameRankings), let alone <a href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-194\">Final Fantasy</a> games, ever made. The game was met with wide critical acclaim, being praised for its varied and complex characters, interesting story, and graphical excellence.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>Final Fantasy VI was the first Final Fantasy game to not be directed by Final Fantasy creator <a href=\"/hironobu-sakaguchi/3040-633/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-633\">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a>, instead being co-directed by <a href=\"/yoshinori-kitase/3040-634/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-634\">Yoshinori Katase</a> and <a href=\"/hiroyuki-itou/3040-16555/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-16555\">Hiroyuki Ito</a>. The composer for the game was famed Final Fantasy composer <a href=\"/nobuo-uematsu/3040-635/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-635\">Nobuo Uematsu</a>. <a href=\"/yoshitaka-amano/3040-639/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-639\">Yoshitaka Amano</a> created the character design for the game, which were then converted into sprites (taking small liberties from time to time, such as changing hair color) by the graphic design team headed by <a href=\"/tetsuya-takahashi/3040-16562/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-16562\">Tetsuya Takahashi</a> (head graphic designer), <a href=\"/hideo-minaba/3040-45954/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45954\">Hideo Minaba</a> (background graphics), Kazuko Shibuyo (object graphics), and <a href=\"/tetsuya-nomura/3040-637/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-637\">Tetsuya Nomura</a> (who designed some characters).</p><p>The game also utilized the Super Nintendo's unique <a href=\"/mode-7/3015-184/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-184\">Mode 7</a> capabilities.

There were no major gameplay changes, like previous games in the series, but much of the script was changed. The game's translator, <a href=\"/ted-woolsey/3040-50831/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-50831\">Ted Woolsey</a>, said that the Japanese version contained much \"playfulness and sexuality\" that couldn't be carried over due to Nintendo of America's strict guidelines.</p><p>As is common in games, most of the names changed, for a variety of different reasons. Some names were changed because they broke the six character limit (Stragus to Strago), while others were changed to seem more exotic (Tina to Terra). Since the game came out before the ESRB ( <a href=\"/entertainment-software-ratings-board/3010-6476/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6476\">Entertainment Software Ratings Board</a>) was a standard, many changes had to be made due to sexual or violent content. The text files had to be shortened because of the limited space in the cartridge. It took Ted Woolsey only 30 days to complete the translation all by himself.</p><p>Many of the sprites in the Japanese version of the game were bordering on nudity, so these were edited. The woman form of the Chadarnook was edited to cover up more of the skin, as was the Critic, Goddess, and Siren sprites. The sprites used in the final battle also differ; the Japanese version is much larger than the American version.</p><h3>Other Versions</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844491\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 395px\" data-ratio=\"0.55189873417722\" data-width=\"395\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-844491\"><img alt=\"Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png 395w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png 395w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/844491-final_fantasy_sgi_demo.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game</figcaption></figure><p>Final Fantasy VI has been re released in various forms on a variety of systems after its original Super Famicom/SNES release. First, there was a technical demonstration based on the original Final Fantasy VI, called Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game. In the game, players controlled Terra, Locke, and Shadow in various battles by drawing patterns with a mouse, each pattern corresponding to a different move. The game was used to demonstrate the uses of SGI ( Silicon Graphics, Inc.) and a possible graphical direction for Square's next RPG.

Other notable things included were a bestiary and artwork library that were accessible from the title screen. Various other things were added, such as new opening and closing effects to battles, the option to quicksave (although all saving still had to be initiated manually), and bug fixes (as well as new bugs being created). The standalone edition of the game had a limited edition that shipped fifty-thousand copies and came with an alarm clock.

This version is more extensively changed than the PlayStation ports, but without the load times before each of the game's many <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">randomly triggered encounters</a>. New gameplay features, redone graphics, and a retranslated script are among the most notable things included. Four new Espers were included in the game (Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactuar, and Diabolos), as well as two new locations: the Dragons' Den (which included a new boss, the Kaiser Dragon) and the Soul Shrine (in which players could battle enemies continuously). Three new spells are included in the game, and bugs from the original are fixed. A bestiary and music player are also included in the game. In addition, the boxart and game-related art has been redone as well, again by Yoshitaka Amano. One scene, in which Celes is beaten, has been removed from the game, presumably due to events in Japan at the time of release. The game was relatively well-received from both critics and fans alike; it holds a a 92% average rating on Metacritic and a 91% average on GameRankings.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288241\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1024px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288241\"><img alt=\"An example of the overworld\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"An example of the overworld\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288241-ff329.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>An example of the overworld</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay of Final Fantasy VI is similar to that of its predecessors and of other 16-bit Japanese RPGs. Player characters move about the game’s fictional setting, completing a story-fueled series of objectives: reaching a certain location, defeating a certain enemy, retrieving a certain item, solving a puzzle, figuring out what to do next, etc. The gameplay is often broken up by story and dialogue sequences, which advance the story through generally non-interactive conversations and events. Over the course of the game, the player-controlled party grows to include a handful of unique characters; this group acts as the primary perspective from which players view the unfolding plot. As they battle enemies (which are <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">encountered at random</a> and are unavoidable) these player characters gain EXP (experience points), which allow them to gain levels. Every time a character gains a level, his or her stats (attributes upon which combat capability depends) are raised, allowing the character to fight more powerful enemies more easily.</p><p>There are four main screens in the game.</p><p>In the overworld screen, the player party traverses an expansive land, moving between various locales (towns and dungeons). More parts of the overworld and more locales become accessible as the player makes progress through the game. The party is susceptible to <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">randomly triggered battles</a> in the overworld.</p><p>Towns and dungeons are accessible from the overworld. In this screen, the player party moves about smaller-scale areas, interacting with NPCs and environmental objects. Towns generally include shops and inns, whose goods and services are bought with GP (currency). Towns are populated by numerous NPCs, with which the player can converse. Dungeons are more dangerous, as the party is vulnerable to enemy attacks while exploring them, due to <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">randomly triggered encounters</a>, and no shops or inns are found within. (Although Tents can be used at save points to replenish the party's health and magic, serving the same purpose as an inn.) Often contained in a dungeon is one of many powerful boss enemies, most of which must be fought in the course of the game. Dungeons are usually larger and more complexly designed than towns. Towns and dungeons are the primary settings for cutscenes and plot events.</p><p>In the battle screen, the player controls the party as it fights against an enemy or enemies. The player enters the battle screen when a random or scripted battle is commenced, and exits by winning, fleeing, or losing the battle. (Losing a battle results in a game over, meaning that all the player's progress since their last save point is lost, and the player is sent back to the title screen without even being offered a chance to try that battle again). In battle, the player does not directly control character movement; instead, the player selects battle commands from menus unique to the individual party members.</p><p>The menu screen is accessible from the overworld and town/dungeon screens. Here, the player can use items, manage party members’ equipment and abilities, view their stats, change game settings, and save their progress. (which has to be done manually)</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670302\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 512px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670302\"><img alt=\"A typical battle screen.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A typical battle screen.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670302-final_fantasy_iii.042.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A typical battle screen.</figcaption></figure><p>Final Fantasy VI's battles (which are most often random) utilize the <a href=\"/active-time-battle/3015-95/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-95\">Active Time Battle</a> system first implemented in <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\">Final Fantasy IV</a>. Each character has his or her own action gauge, which fills up at a rate dependent on the character's speed stat. When the gauge is full, the character can perform actions chosen from his or her command list. Such actions include performing a basic attack, casting a magic spell, using an item, and drawing upon the unique ability of the character.</p><p>Magic, as in all Final Fantasy games, can be used for a range of purposes. Primarily, spells are used to inflict damage, bestow status conditions (both positive and negative), and heal. To cast a spell, a character must use MP, which can be restored similarly to HP. If a character's current MP is lower than the MP cost of a spell, he or she will be unable to cast it. MP, like HP, is a stat; as it rises, the character's maximum MP count will rise.</p><p>As in many Final Fantasy games, the combat screen is separated into one large rectangle on top, in which all the action takes place, and one smaller one at the bottom of the screen, in which the player inputs commands. Certain non-interactive cutscenes also take place in the combat screen, with characters displayed as battle sprites.</p><p>When the party wins a battle, it gains EXP, GP, and (sometimes) AP (see the \"Equipment\" section below). Defeated enemies sometimes also drop items or equipment.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-671528\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 512px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-671528\"><img alt=\"Browsing through items at an item store\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Browsing through items at an item store\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/671528-final_fantasy_iii.027.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Browsing through items at an item store</figcaption></figure><p>There is a lot of equipment in the game, providing for great lengths of customization. The right hand, left hand, head, and body can all be customized with a wide variety of weapons and armor. Weapons determine the nature of characters' physical attacks, while shields and armor boost their stats (primarily defense and magic defense). Generally, one hand holds a weapon, one hand holds a shield, the head holds headgear, and the body holds body armor. However, the Genji Glove and Gauntlet relics (see below) allow characters to break the rules regarding weapon-equipping.</p><p>Relics are items that have effects less traditional than those of weapons and armor. Two can be equipped at once by each character, allowing them to bestow myriad potential bonus combinations. Examples of relics include the Sniper Sight (which ensures a 100% hit rate of basic attacks), the Black Belt (which grants a 50% chance of counterattacking against enemies' physical strikes), and the Alarm Earring (which prevents back attacks and pincer attacks). Relics can protect against various status conditions, bestow positive status conditions, change the nature of attacks or abilities, and boost stats. There are also relics that offer out-of-battle bonuses; for example, the Sprint Shoes double walking speed in towns and dungeons.</p><p>Espers add a deep customization element to the game's magic system. Although they are not introduced particularly early in the game, they are an essential part of the game's character customization. Espers collected in their Magicite forms are the primary means by which characters learn magic spells. Each one has a unique set of spells, and each spell has a corresponding rate multiplier (a spell's multiplier usually varies between the different Espers that teach it). When a character has equipped an Esper (each character can equip one at a time), battling will further his or her learning of the Esper's spells: the number of AP (ability points) earned at the end of battle is multiplied by each spell's rate multiplier and added to the spell's growth percentage, which represents the character's learning progress. When the character's growth percentage for a spell reaches 100, he or she learns it. When the Esper is unequipped from the character, all its growth percentages (and availability of learned spells) remain; even if a percentage is lower than 100, the character can later continue adding to it by equipping another Esper (or the same Esper) with the given spell.</p><p>Espers also feature as the game's summons. Each equipped Esper can be summoned once per battle to perform its unique spell; these summon spells are generally more powerful than most commonly learned magic. No AP growth is needed to perform summons.</p><p>It should be noted that, due to the workings of the Magicite system, every character in the game (save Gogo and Umaro, who cannot equip Espers) can learn every spell, even though Terra and Celes are the only ones who can learn magic through leveling.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The game's story begins 1,000 years in the past during the War of the Magi. Espers had power, and men wanted that. What was necessary to obtain it was to kill the Esper and collect the remains, called Magicite. It was total war, very nearly apocalyptic in its scope. Society needed 1,000 years to return to a semblance of what it was before hand. With the Espers now in self-imposed exile, the war came to a close.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-286858\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 640px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-286858\"><img alt=\"Terra, Biggs, and Wedge search for an Esper during the opening credits.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Terra, Biggs, and Wedge search for an Esper during the opening credits.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/286858-ff__.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Terra, Biggs, and Wedge search for an Esper during the opening credits.</figcaption></figure><p>The game opens with Terra, an amnesiac girl aiding the Empire in searching the village of Narshe for an Esper (specifically, the Esper 'Tritoch'). After dispatching a few guards, the group comes upon the Esper. The guards approach it slowly, but Terra reacts strangely to it, killing the guards. When she awakes, she is under the care of an old man who claims to be part of a rebel group known as the Returners. He explains that Terra has been controlled by a Slave Crown, forcing her to do the Empire's bidding. He agrees to assist her, when all of the sudden, Imperial Soldiers come knocking at the door. The old man quickly tells Terra to flee, showing her the back way.</p><p>The player is then introduced to Locke Cole, a cocky, self-assured thief (although he prefers 'treasure hunter'). He aids Terra in the fight against the Imperial Soldiers, as well as enlisting the help of several Moogles. After the battle, Locke vows to protect Terra no matter the cost, and proceeds to do so at the best of his ability. After assisting in protecting Terra from Imperial Soldiers, he is tasked with leading Terra to the hideout of the Returners.</p><p>Along the way, the small party stops at Figaro Castle. There, they are introduced to the \"ladies' man\" Edgar Roni Figaro. Edgar is charming, and attempts in sweet-talking Terra, although she is unlike other women that Edgar has courted, as she seems incapable of love. Edgar is seemingly an ally with the Empire, but in reality he is an essential leader of the Returners. After being introduced to Edgar, Kefka comes in search of Terra. Kefka lies that the girl is \"of no importance\" to the Empire, but everyone present sees past Kefka's ploy.</p><p>Edgar bravely lies, saying that Terra is not in the castle. In response, Kefka sets his castle on fire. As he is laughing manically, the party manages to escape, and then the castle dives beneath the sand (moving over to an area near Kohlingen). Kefka is humiliated and outraged, especially after the party manages to dispatch his Magitek soldiers. The party makes their way to Mt. Koltz, where Sabin Rene Figaro is introduced. Vargas (Duncan's son) attacks the party, due to the fact that he believes his father will give the fighting dojo he owns to Sabin. A brief scene plays out in which Sabin disposes of Vargas, who was intent on murdering Sabin in order to gain the dojo. After a brief reuniting \"ceremony,\" the party sets out once again for the Returners' headquarters.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670288\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 512px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670288\"><img alt=\"The Returners' headquarters\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Returners' headquarters\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670288-final_fantasy_iii.026.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Returners' headquarters</figcaption></figure><p>Upon reaching the Returners' headquarters, the leader, Banon, requests Terra's assistance in dethroning the Empire. The player is given the choice of whether or not to accept the offer, but either way Terra will end up aiding the Returners. After Terra accepts, a battle plan is laid out. Unfortunately, a Returner bursts and announces that the town of South Figaro has been attacked by Imperial forces. Locke goes to investigate, while the rest of the party escapes on the Lethe River. After a battle with Ultros, however, the party is separated from Sabin, whom is thrown off to an unknown destination.</p><p>The player then has the choice to choose between Locke's scenario, Sabin's scenario, or Edgar and Terra's scenario. All must be chosen eventually, but the order is up to the player. In Edgar and Terra's scenario, the party merely fights their way through several enemies and eventually makes it to Narshe.</p><p>In Locke's scenario, Locke is in South Figaro. The town is crawling with Imperial Soldiers, so Locke steals some clothes to impersonate a merchant. He uses this disguise to infiltrate one of the buildings that the Imperial Soldiers are using as headquarters. Here, he steals some clothes from an Imperial Soldier, and traverses throughout the house. In the back, he finds Celes, a former general for the Empire who has been infused with artificial magical abilities. She has been labeled as a traitor, although trusting her throughout the game is always risky, and is referenced constantly. She agrees to join the Returners. The two manage to make it back to Narshe as well.</p><p>Sabin awakes near a house somewhere in the overworld. He meets Shadow, a ninja, whom is willing to accompany him, for a fee. They travel to the city of Doma, where they encounter an Imperial force. Kefka is there, and he impatiently wants to poison Doma's water supply as to speed up the occupation process. After General Leo leaves, Kefka follows through with his plan, despite direct orders from Leo not to go through with it. Everyone in the city except for Cyan dies. Cyan angrily leaves and begins to blindly attack at the enemies, hitting Sabin in the process. He apologizes, and the team agrees that they are there for the same reason; to dispose of the Empire. They proceed to escape by using the Magitek Armor that is in the camp (it is notable that this is the last time that the player can use Magitek Armor). After traveling for a while, the party comes upon a forest.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817059-final_fantasy_vi_phantom_train.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817059\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.8671875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817059-final_fantasy_vi_phantom_train.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-817059\"><img alt=\"Sabin and Cyan try to escape the Phantom Train\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817059-final_fantasy_vi_phantom_train.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817059-final_fantasy_vi_phantom_train.jpg 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sabin and Cyan try to escape the Phantom Train\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817059-final_fantasy_vi_phantom_train.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/817059-final_fantasy_vi_phantom_train.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sabin and Cyan try to escape the Phantom Train</figcaption></figure><p>In the forest, they find a train.

After much battling, the party manages to make it off the train. Cyan then witnesses his wife and son boarding. Sadly, he cries for them, and blames himself for what happened in Doma. After making it to the small town of Mobliz, the party is introduced to a young boy known as Gau. He is rather insane, as he lives in the Veldt, a strip of land inhabited only by feral animals. The party befriends him, and he gives them his \"treasure,\" an underwater breathing apparatus. They use this to travel underwater. The party emerges in the town of Nikeah. In Nikeah, there is a port, which can take the party to Narshe. They board the boat, and manage to make it back to Narshe.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288279\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1024px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-288279\"><img alt=\"The exterior of Figaro Castle\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The exterior of Figaro Castle\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1762/288279-ff331.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The exterior of Figaro Castle</figcaption></figure><p>After reuniting in Narshe--along with new members Cyan, Gau, and Celes--the group prepares to defend the frozen Esper encountered in the beginning of the game. After holding off the Imperial forces long enough, however, Terra transforms into a strange pink form, and flies off. The party attempts to track her down, eventually finding her in the town of Zozo.</p><p>Here, she is being cared for by the Esper Ramuh, who tells them about the Espers, Magicite, and then implores them to infiltrate the Magitek Research Facility, where his friends are being tortured and drained of their power. To reach the facility, however, an airship is required. Setzer, a renowned thief, owns the only airship in the world. He has threatened to kidnap Maria, the star of an opera. Celes has an uncanny resemblance to Maria, so she poses as Maria.</p><p>Setzer holds up to his promise and kidnaps \"Maria,\" but the party comes along as well. Setzer finds this rather humorous and agrees to assist the party. After retrieving the Espers, including one named Maduin (who is Terra's father), the party returns to Zozo. The power of the Magicite that the Espers have transformed into shows Terra her past. Her mother stumbled into the Esper world long ago. One Esper took pity on her, Maduin, and the two fell in love. They had a child, Terra. Soon, however, Emperor Gestahl, Kefka, and the Imperial Forces make it into the Esper world. To wipe them out, the Espers do a magical spell to cleanse the world of any humans. Unfortunately, Terra and her mother are taken out as well. Emperor Gestahl notices Terra, and adopts her to be his warrior. After this flashback, Terra gains the ability to switch between her Esper and human forms.</p><p>After reuniting with Terra, the Returners decide that it is time for a final attack against the Empire. The Returners request Terra's assistance in asking the Espers for help. Terra does so, but the human world causes the Espers to attack violently, similarly to when Terra first transformed into an Esper. The Espers completely annihilate the capitol city of the Empire, Vector. Emperor Gestahl is astounded at the destruction caused by the Espers, so he requests an alliance between the Returners and the Empire. Locke and Terra are grouped with Shadow, Celes, and General Leo as they search for the Espers to lay out the terms of peace.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670328\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 512px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-670328\"><img alt=\"Emperor Gestahl makes peace with the Returners\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Emperor Gestahl makes peace with the Returners\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/670328-final_fantasy_iii.068.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Emperor Gestahl makes peace with the Returners</figcaption></figure><p>Upon arriving at the town of Thamasa, the party finds that no one has any knowledge of Espers or magic, and the village's inhabitants act very hostile towards the party. The party discovers an elderly mage, Strago, who has knowledge of the Espers and magic (although he refuses to admit it). He eventually befriends the party and reveals that the village's inhabitants are all descendants of mages that fought in the War of the Magi. He recommends that the party go get some sleep. During the night, he rushes in shouting that one of the houses is on fire, and his granddaughter, Relm, is trapped inside. The party manages to rescue her, and the two join the party to search for the Espers. Soon enough, they find the Espers, and the peace terms are laid out by General Leo (who is unaware of the evil plans of Gestahl and Kefka). This peaceful gathering is quickly interrupted by Kefka. He absorbs the power from all of the Espers, and after resistance from Leo, promptly murders him.</p><p>The Returners are reunited, and by now, it is clear what Kefka and Emperor Gestahl's evil intentions are. They plan to resurrect the Floating Continent. To do so, they must go into the now open Esper world and collect the remains of the Warring Triad. They easily do so, and the island that the Esper world is located on rises into the sky: the Floating Continent.</p><p>Three statues are in place on the Floating Continent that provide perfect balance for the entire world. If moved even the slightest, the world could be reshaped and destroyed. Obviously, Kefka and Gestahl have evil intent. After fighting their way to Kefka and Gestahl, the party is all knocked unconscious except for Celes (whose allegiance is shaky). Kefka offers her a sword and commands her to kill the party. She refuses, and instead stabs Kefka. Kefka is angered by this, and he begins to use the magic that the statues are granting him. Gestahl is opposed to this, but is quickly disposed of by Kefka. Kefka then moves all of the statues around, causing what is best described as the end of the world.</p><p>Fortunately, the game does not end there. The second part of the game, the World of Ruin, begins with Celes awaking from a year-long coma. After awakening, she finds herself on an island under the care of Cid, who has become a fatherly figure to her. Cid reveals to Celes that he has become gravely ill and at that moment, the game leaves his fate in the player's hands. The player can choose to have Celes nurse Cid back to good health by catching and feeding him \"yummy\" or regular fish. Conversely, Cid can die by feeding him rotten fish or if Celes does not tend to his illness. If Cid dies, Celes will find a raft that he built so she could sail to freedom, but not before attempting suicide (which is referenced more in the Japanese version of the game). If Cid lives, he will show Celes the raft he was building and give it to her so she can leave the island. Regardless of whether Cid lives or dies, Celes will eventually set out to find all of her friends.</p><p>The World of Ruin is mostly non-linear (as opposed to the World of Balance), and after acquiring a certain amount of required party members, the player can proceed to Kefka's Tower, where he rules with an iron fist. Each character has a unique story during the World of Ruin, and while some are optional, it is definitely interesting to see where they have gone. In addition, each character has an optional side-quest that maximizes their power. Optional characters Umaro and Gogo and be obtained during the World of Ruin as well. After destroying the three statues housed inside, the party makes their way to Kefka. He has drained the Warring Triad of their power, so now he has godlike strength. He launches into a monologue, enraged that the world can still cling to hope, citing the World of Ruin as a reason why the party should just give up hope. After each of the party's members gives a personal example of why he or she still has hope, the final battle begins.</p><p>After the destruction of Kefka, it is revealed that all the Magicite that was in him helped keep magic in power. Destroying Kefka means the end of magic, meaning the potential destruction of Terra. As Terra helps the party escape in her Esper form, her father comes and tells her that if she can cling onto her human side, she may survive. The airship Falcon manages to catch her as she falls, and she survives: a human. The world is saved, Kefka has been defeated. A montage of clips from various portions of the world plays, showing how the citizens are rebuilding the world after the horror of Kefka's reign.</p><h2>Playable Characters</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-710531\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 512px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-710531\"><img alt=\"All of the playable characters except for Shadow and Gau\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"All of the playable characters except for Shadow and Gau\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/710531-final_fantasy_iii.015.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>All of the playable characters except for Shadow and Gau</figcaption></figure><p>Fourteen characters are fully playable in the game. They range from a little girl with a talent for painting to a full-grown yeti. While the plot initially forces the player to use certain characters at certain times, later sections of the game leave party creation largely to the player. Dialogue at certain plot points is entirely dependent on the player's chosen party composition. In this way, the game takes a significant step towards a more rewarding role-playing experience.</p><p>Each character has a back story significant to his or her development, if not to the main plot. The depth of the cast is commonly praised as a highlight of the game, and some character subplots are arguably more compelling than the main storyline. In the World of Ruin section, most characters have optional side-stories that delve into their histories and their psyches more deeply than the main story. For instance, in Cyan's side-quest, the party explores his subconsciousness, eventually freeing him from a captor demon. He meets the ghosts of his wife and child, and they encourage him to not hold himself responsible for the events that transpired in Doma. Each of these side-quests addresses a previously touched-upon attribute (personality trait, life event, etc.) of its central character.</p><h3>Terra Branford</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/417761-6_terra_a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-417761\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 290px\" data-ratio=\"1.3793103448276\" data-width=\"290\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/417761-6_terra_a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-417761\"><img alt=\"Terra Branford\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/417761-6_terra_a.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/417761-6_terra_a.jpg 290w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Terra Branford\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/417761-6_terra_a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/417761-6_terra_a.jpg 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Terra Branford</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/terra-branford/3005-515/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-515\">Terra</a> (Tina in the Japanese version) is a girl with mysterious origins whom the player are first introduced to in the beginning of the game.

The soldiers (and Terra) are in a powerful suit known as Magitek Armor that gives the wearer incredible defense, strength, stamina, health, and even powerful magic attacks. After the group finds the Esper, Terra reacts strangely to it and the group of soldiers with her disappear.</p><p>Later in the game, it is revealed that Terra is the daughter of an Esper named Maduin and a human mother named Madonna. Madonna somehow ended up in the Esper realm and Maduin fell in love with her. When Imperial Soldiers attempt to invade the Esper realm, Madonna and her baby girl are sucked back into the human realm, where Terra is raised by Emperor Gestahl. She is said to have destroyed fifty Imperial Soldiers in one exercise, so Gestahl controls her through an item called the Slave Crown (which is later removed by The Returners).</p><p>In the World of Ruin, Terra is found in the town of Mobliz, caring for all of the children who lost their parents when the Light of Judgment obliterated their town. Terra fears that she isn't powerful enough anymore, but when she annihilates a monster that comes to destroy the children, she gains courage and encourages the children to live for hope. She then joins the party to keep Kefka from causing the world anymore pain.</p><p>At one point in the game, Terra learns her special ability: Morph. This allows her to transform into an Esper and boosts her magic and physical attack. Her Esper form is a glowing pink figure with long hair. She can switch back and forth between it.</p><h3>Locke Cole</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11428-locke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11428\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 339px\" data-ratio=\"1.1297935103245\" data-width=\"339\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:113.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11428-locke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11428\"><img alt=\"Locke Cole\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" data-width=\"566\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11428-locke.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11428-locke.jpg 339w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Locke Cole\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11428-locke.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11428-locke.jpg 339w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" data-width=\"566\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Locke Cole</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/locke-cole/3005-516/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-516\">Locke</a> (Lock in the Japanese version) is a young thief. However, whenever he is referred to as a thief--be it by a close friend or a stranger--he becomes enraged and claims that he is a 'treasure hunter.' His special ability is Steal, which allows him to take items from certain enemies. A Relic, the Thief Glove, can turn this attack into Capture, in which Locke attacks and steals at the same time. In the beginning of the game, Locke vows to protect both Terra and Celes, and attempts to keep that promise at the best of his ability.</p><p>Locke was in love with a girl from Kohlingen named Rachel, who normally accompanied him on his treasure hunts. On one hunt, Rachel fell and suffered an injury that caused amnesia. She forgot that she loved Locke, but he stays anyway. He is eventually too heartbroken to stay any longer, so he leaves. During his absence, the Empire attacks, and Rachel is killed. Her father says that her final words were Locke's name. Locke is so hard on himself that he searches far and wide for a way to bring her back to life. He finds a Magicite known as Phoenix that is supposed to heal people from the dead. Since it is damaged, the effects are temporary, but Rachel tells Locke not to be too hard on himself, and that she loves him.</p><h3>Cyan Garamonde</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398517\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1625px\" data-ratio=\"1.2603076923077\" data-width=\"1625\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:126.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-398517\"><img alt=\"Cyan Garamonde\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px\" data-width=\"507\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg 1625w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg 1523w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg 761w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg 507w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cyan Garamonde\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg 1625w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg 1523w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg 761w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14211/398517-cyangaramonde.jpg 507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px\" data-width=\"507\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cyan Garamonde</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/cyan-garamonde/3005-519/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-519\">Cyan</a> (Cayenne in the Japanese version) is a loyal servant of the king of Doma. Cyan's special ability is SwdTech (short for 'Sword Technique'), a powerful attack that has eight levels (that must be upgraded by doing various things). The eight levels are selected via a time bar that slowly goes across the numbers. The SwdTech attacks do a variety of things, from multiple hits with Cyan's sword, to a one hit kill. Cyan typically speaks in Old English, saying things such as \"thou art\" or \"sayeth.\" This trait is poked fun at constantly throughout the game.</p><p>When Kefka poisons Doma's water supply, everyone close to Cyan perishes (including his wife, Elaine, and his son, Owain). Angry at the Empire, he joins the Returners, where he later meets Gau, his best friend. In the World of Ruin, Cyan takes pity on a girl whose boyfriend isn't responding to her letters (due to his death), so he lives on top of Mount Zozo, writing letters to her.</p><h3>Shadow</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391733-shadow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391733\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 396px\" data-ratio=\"1.3181818181818\" data-width=\"396\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391733-shadow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391733\"><img alt=\"Shadow\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" data-width=\"485\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391733-shadow.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391733-shadow.jpg 396w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Shadow\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391733-shadow.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391733-shadow.jpg 396w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" data-width=\"485\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Shadow</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/shadow/3005-521/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-521\">Shadow</a> (real name Clyde) is a mysterious mercenary and assassin who would supposedly \"slit his mama's throat for a nickel.\" He appears frequently throughout the game, and plays an important role during the climax of the game.

Shadow's special attack is Throw, in which he can throw a wide variety of items at the enemy for varying amounts of damage. Occasionally, Interceptor will also counterattack the enemy.</p><p>Shadow appears a few times during the first half of the game, sometimes offering services (for a fee of course). During the climax, he stays behind to help save the world, and if the player stays with him, Shadow can be found in the Cave in the Veldt, where he will join the party permanently.</p><p>A little can be found out about Shadow through dream sequences by sleeping with him in the party at an Inn. He was originally a thief named Clyde, who traveled with friend and fellow thief Baram. During a heist of one million GP, Baram gets injured and requests that Clyde kills him. Clyde runs, leaving him to an uncertain fate. He them settles down in Thamasa with a woman named Madonna, where he has a daughter (hinted to be Relm).

He likes to think of himself as a lady's man, but most of the time he comes across as being more immature than actually having a chance with women. He is the older brother of Sabin. Edgar's special ability is Tools, which allows him to use Tools found in the adventure, such as a Drill that causes an amount of damage, or a Debilitator which causes a certain magical weakness in the enemy.</p><p>When Edgar's father died, neither Sabin nor Edgar wanted to inherit the crown, so they decided to flip for it. In one of the most famous scenes in the game, Edgar flips a coin, and it is decided that he will inherit the crown. Later in the game (when Celes uses the same coin to trick Setzer into letting the party use his airship), it is revealed that he nobly used a double-sided coin so that his brother wouldn't have to rule Figaro.</p><p>In the World of Ruin, Edgar disguises himself as a thief named Gerad, and keeps the disguise until he breaks into Figaro Castle. He then reveals that he is Edgar, and fights alongside the party.</p><h3>Sabin Rene Figaro</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11430-sabin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11430\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 286px\" data-ratio=\"1.4440559440559\" data-width=\"286\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11430-sabin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-11430\"><img alt=\"Sabin Rene Figaro\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px\" data-width=\"286\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11430-sabin.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11430-sabin.jpg 286w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sabin Rene Figaro\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11430-sabin.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/11430-sabin.jpg 286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 286px) 100vw, 286px\" data-width=\"286\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sabin Rene Figaro</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/sabin-rene-figaro/3005-518/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-518\">Sabin</a> (Mash in the Japanese version) is the aforementioned younger brother of Edgar Roni Figaro. He left his inheritance to the throne to train in martial arts under a man named Duncan. Sabin's special ability is Blitz. When selected, a control code must be inputted to do a certain attack. For example right, left, right would be the control code for the move Pummel. Sabin can learn more Blitzes throughout the game, which are increasingly complex.</p><p>Sabin wins the coin toss with Edgar (the one that Edgar rigged with a double-sided coin), so he leaves his inheritance and trains under a world famous Duncan Harcourt. Duncan's son, Vargas, becomes jealous when he realizes that Sabin is superior in martial arts, and that Duncan might leave the dojo to him. Vargas attempts to murder Sabin, and then escapes to Mount Koltz, where he is defeated by Sabin. He then proceeds to reunite with Edgar, and join the party.</p><p>In the World of Ruin, Sabin is found in Tzen, holding up a building to keep the child inside from burning alive. After rescuing the child from inside, Sabin will join the party.

Strago is a descendant of the Mage Warriors, hence his natural magic abilities. His ancestors fought in the War of the Magi. Apparently, Relm is not Strago's actual granddaughter, but a 'friend's daughter.' It is hinted at during Shadow's flashbacks that he is the actual father of Relm.</p><p>After talking to Strago in Thamasa, everyone in the town becomes more friendly. The innkeeper lowers the price to sleep there from 1000GP to 1GP. Despite Strago denying any connection to magic or the Espers, it is eventually revealed that he indeed can use magic and has a knowledge of Espers. During the night, he asks the party to save his granddaughter, Relm, from a burning building. After rescuing her, Strago will join the party, and eventually Relm will as well.</p><p>In the World of Ruin, Strago is first found in the Cult of Kefka. If Relm is in the party, however, he snaps out of his trance, and joins the party. Upon returning to Thamasa, one of Strago's friends fakes and injury and claims that it came from the beast Hidon, a monster that Strago spent almost his entire life chasing. His curiosity renewed, he goes to search again. After finding and defeated Hidon, Strago is the happiest he's ever been, and Relm thanks his friend for it.</p><h3>Relm Arrowny</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/191847-relm.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191847\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 202px\" data-ratio=\"1.490099009901\" data-width=\"202\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/191847-relm.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-191847\"><img alt=\"Relm Arrowny\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px\" data-width=\"202\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/191847-relm.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/191847-relm.gif 202w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Relm Arrowny\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/191847-relm.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/191847-relm.gif 202w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px\" data-width=\"202\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Relm Arrowny</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/relm-arrowny/3005-522/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-522\">Relm</a> is a ten year old (although she is much smarter than an average ten year old) from Thamasa.

If the Relic Fake Mustache is attached to Relm, Sketch is replaced with Control, which allows the player to control the enemy that the attack is used on.

One of the most notorious of all the Final Fantasy villains; he isn’t a living incarnation of sin, or a supreme god-like being come to plunge the world into utter darkness. He is just an evil, evil man; one part coward, one part clown, one part mage, and one part nihilistic megalomaniac bent on world domination. His infamous cackle is one of the first things verbally spoken in a Final Fantasy game.</p><p>Kefka was born and immediately abandoned. He was raised in a Thamasa orphanage in which he was beaten often by the orphanage head. He developed a cold, quiet personality due to his early experiences. Kefka eventually migrated to Vector and entered the Imperial academy where he graduated at the top of his class. Cid immediately recognized his talents and took him on as an apprentice, putting him in prime position to be the first volunteer for the Magitek Knight program. He was genetically fused with magic through an imperfect program, but for years showed no signs of it affecting his sanity whatsoever.</p><p>He went on to become incredibly successful within the Empire, taking command of the Magitek Knights at only 23 years of age. It was then that he met Celes Chere, an orphaned citizen of Tzen, and took a liking to her. Celes became his apprentice and he pulled several strings to ensure that she became a Magitek Knight herself. Kefka's imperial career peaked at age 31 when he was made Imperial Prime Minister, a position second only to Emperor Gestahl himself. Kefka gained fame as a brilliant tactician and strategic savant. It was at this time that Kefka's sanity began to deteriorate, most likely due to imperfections in the original magic-infusing process he underwent from Cid.</p><p>At a banquet celebrating Celes' promotion to Rear Admiral, Kefka finally cracked with a violent outburst, and slid quickly into insanity afterward. Once shy and taciturn, Kefka began dressing in garish clown costumes and wearing makeup. Memories of his teenage and adult life began to fade away, leaving only his horrid childhood. Thus he became more cruel and more hateful and eventually developed a bloodlust and an obsession with destruction. Gestahl noticed this and removed him from the military.</p><p>However, Gestahl was still thankful to Kefka for his years of service beyond expectation and stellar military record, so Kefka was placed at the position of Court Mage. His former position was filled by General Leo, which sparked Kefka's intense jealousy and hatred of the man which culminates during the events of the game. Kefka's reputation among imperial soldiers is on display in the camp outside Doma castle during Sabin's scenario. He has a reputation as a coward, yet many of the imperial soldiers still fear him due to his being prone to wild fits of rage and violence.</p><p>Kefka is responsible for many of the game's events. He is the one who demands that a Slave Crown be put on Terra's head. He also is responsible for the poisoning of Doma's water supply; after General Leo takes too long to formulate an attack plan, Kefka decides to take matters into his own hands and poisons the water. He is also at the Magitek Research Facility, where he physically and mentally abuses Espers to suck them dry of their power. In a ploy later in the game, Emperor Gestahl puts Kefka in prison, claiming that his poisoning of Doma was unnecessary and cruel. After it is revealed to be an evil Imperial plot, Kefka comes to Thamasa where he turns the congregated Espers into Magicite.</p><p>Using that power, Kefka and Emperor Gestahl revive the Floating Continent, where statues that keep the world in balance reside. After the party reaches him, he freezes them all (except Celes) with power that he is getting from the statues. He then orders her to stab the party, and gives her a sword. Refusing, she stabs him instead. Kefka is annoyed and enraged, but not fatally wounded. He orders the statues to kill them all. Gestahl, afraid that Kefka is going to upset the gentle balance of the statues, shouts at him to stop. Kefka refuses, and then kills Gestahl and merely kicks his body off the edge of the Floating Continent. He then moves all of the statues around, reshaping the World of Balance into the World of Ruin.</p><p>In the World of Ruin, Kefka is technically the \"god\" of the land. He rules with an iron fist from atop his perch in Kefka's Tower. If so little as one person opposes him, he destroys their entire town with the \"Light of Judgment.\" The effects of this are seen in several places, especially in Tzen and Mobliz. Followers of his have joined a cult called the Cult of Kefka. Members walk around mindlessly, and one villager says that there is no hope for them. However, Strago is seen with them, and he can be revived.</p><p>After reaching the top of Kefka's Tower, Kefka can't believe that the party can have so much hope in such a ruined world. They all use examples from their personal lives (and quests in the game). This angers Kefka, and he takes on his god form, which has several stages with multiple forms in each stage. After defeating him, the end of magic in the world is witnessed. Terra, being part Esper, was believed to be one of the casualties at first, but then she lands on the airship, alive and well.</p><h3>Emperor Gestahl</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/188595-gestahl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-188595\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 167px\" data-ratio=\"1.1916167664671\" data-width=\"167\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:119.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/188595-gestahl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-188595\"><img alt=\"Emperor Gestahl\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px\" data-width=\"167\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/188595-gestahl.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/188595-gestahl.jpg 167w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Emperor Gestahl\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/188595-gestahl.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4358/188595-gestahl.jpg 167w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 167px) 100vw, 167px\" data-width=\"167\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Emperor Gestahl</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/gestahl/3005-529/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-529\">Gestahl</a> (he is Gastra in the Japanese version) is the ruler of the Empire. Gestahl has ruled the Empire ever since its beginning, and is obsessed with harnessing magical energy for aid in his military conquest. He once managed to infiltrate the Esper home world, but was quickly ejected from it (along with Terra and her mother). When the Espers realize that he is attempting to come into their home again, they break free of the gate, and--being unable to control their power at first--they completely obliterate the capital city of Vector. Amazed at their power, the Empire lay down their arms, and Kefka is thrown in jail for his crimes. It is, however, merely a ploy to get into the Esper home world. General Leo, the most noble general of the Empire, is kept out of the secret, however, so when he tries to protect the Espers, he is killed by Kefka.</p><p>Gestahl underestimates Kefka's own insanity, and ends up being murdered when he tries to stop him. He is shamed by Kefka when his dead body is disrespectfully knocked off the Floating Continent.</p><h3>Cid Del Norte Marguez</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391756-cid__ff6_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391756\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 229px\" data-ratio=\"1.8646288209607\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:186.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391756-cid__ff6_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-391756\"><img alt=\"Cid Del Norte Marguez\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391756-cid__ff6_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391756-cid__ff6_.jpg 229w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cid Del Norte Marguez\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391756-cid__ff6_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3715/391756-cid__ff6_.jpg 229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cid Del Norte Marguez</figcaption></figure><p>Cid is a recurring character in the Final Fantasy franchise. In this particular game, he is the head researcher of the Empire. His work led to several inventions, including Magitek Armor. He is referred to as a grandfather figure to Celes several times in the game, and when she joins the Returners, he begins having doubts about Emperor Gestahl and Kefka's plans. He helps the party by warning them about a trap in Vector and by helping them escape the Magitek Research Facility.</p><p>After the World of Balance is destroyed, Cid (and many others, including Celes) is stranded on a small island. It is subtly referenced that the others all committed suicide by jumping off a large cliff on the island (and Celes attempts to as well, once Cid dies). He cares for Celes for a year while she is in a coma, falling ill while he does so. Once Celes awakens, he dies, but not before revealing a raft that Celes can use to escape the island.</p><h3>General Leo Sharret Cristophe</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/393786-leo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393786\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 289px\" data-ratio=\"1.681660899654\" data-width=\"289\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:168.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/393786-leo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393786\"><img alt=\"General Leo\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/393786-leo.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/393786-leo.jpg 289w\"><noscript><img alt=\"General Leo\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/393786-leo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14211/393786-leo.jpg 289w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\"></noscript></a><figcaption>General Leo</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/general-leo/3005-4559/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4559\">General Leo</a> is one of the two head Imperial Generals (the other being Celes). Leo is more noble than other Imperial leaders, such as Kefka and Gestahl. He was assigned to capture Doma, but when he had to leave, Kefka took over and poisoned the water. He later apologizes to the only remaining survivor, Cyan. During the fake peace treaty between the Empire and the Returners, the fact that it isn't true is kept away from Leo. When the Espers meet to negotiate peace, he does the talking, and convinces them to have peace.</p><p>After Kefka reveals the plan as being fake, Leo bravely defends the Espers and the party. However, Kefka quickly destroys him using the powerful magic that he absorbed from the already dead Espers.</p><p>General Leo was subject to a famous rumor in the '90s. Much like Aerith Gainsborough of Final Fantasy VII, many fans claimed that there was indeed a way to bring Leo back from the demise he fell to at Kefka's hands. These were, however, proven incorrect as it is now confirmed that there is no way to bring back the fan favorite in the World of Ruin aside from altering the game's code.</p><h3>Ultros</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8953/266058-ultroscookieultros.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266058\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 179px\" data-ratio=\"0.73743016759777\" data-width=\"179\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8953/266058-ultroscookieultros.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266058\"><img alt=\"Ultros\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px\" data-width=\"179\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8953/266058-ultroscookieultros.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8953/266058-ultroscookieultros.gif 179w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultros\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8953/266058-ultroscookieultros.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8953/266058-ultroscookieultros.gif 179w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px\" data-width=\"179\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultros</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/ultros/3005-530/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-530\">Ultros</a> (he is Othros in the Japanese version) is a purple talking octopus who appears at many times during the game.

He works as a receptionist for the Colosseum, and his friend Chupon works as a monster when no other monster will fight.</p><h3>Banon</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7715/248699-banon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-248699\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 345px\" data-ratio=\"1.4202898550725\" data-width=\"345\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7715/248699-banon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-248699\"><img alt=\"Banon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7715/248699-banon.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7715/248699-banon.jpg 345w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Banon\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7715/248699-banon.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7715/248699-banon.jpg 345w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Banon</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/banon/3005-2670/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2670\">Banon</a> (Bannan in the Japanese version) is the leader of the Returners, a rather large group of rebels who are determined to overthrow the corrupt Empire. He is playable for a small part of the game (when the party is on the Lethe River). His special ability is Health, which heals the entire party without using any magic points. After the destruction of the World of Balance, he is not encountered again.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>The music of Final Fantasy VI was written by <a href=\"/nobuo-uematsu/3040-635/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-635\">Nobuo Uematsu</a>, who was well-known for his work in previous Final Fantasy games. He composed a theme song for every playable character. In addition to these themes, the soundtrack contains a traditional battle theme, multiple boss fight themes, songs for special events, and songs for several of the towns and other locales. A few tracks exceed ten minutes; these include \"Dancing Mad\", the seventeen minute-long final boss theme, and the \"Ending Theme\", which combines all of the individual character theme songs.</p><p>One of the game's most famous songs is \"Aria di Mezzo Carattere\", a song that is played during the well-known opera scene. The sound chip of the SNES (SPC700 format sound chip) didn't allow for actual voice, so Uematsu created a synthesized voice that sang in rhythm to the song. Later in the SNES' life, some developers figured out how to do actual voice, however. In Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, \"Aria di Mezzo Carattere\" is sung in Italian by Svetla Krasteva.</p><p>There were many albums of Final Fantasy VI's music released. The original soundtrack was released on three discs in both North America (as Final Fantasy III: Kefka's Domain) and Japan (as Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version). Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale was an album that contained orchestral arrangements of Final Fantasy VI's music. Piano Collections: Final Fantasy VI featured music from the game preformed on piano by Reiko Nomura. Final Fantasy VI Special Tracks was an album that consisted of unused songs or remixed music. In addition, many of Final Fantasy VI's songs have been adapted by other bands (such as Nobuo Uematsu's own band The Black Mages, and the band Machinae Supremacy).</p><h3>Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-712084\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.89\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-712084\"><img alt=\"Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/712084-ff6sd.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Omen (4:15)</li><li>The Mines of Narshe (2:48)</li><li>Awakening (1:41)</li><li>Locke's Theme (2:01)</li><li>Battle (1:59)</li><li>Victory Fanfare (0:39)</li><li>Edgar and Sabin's Theme (2:32)</li><li>Kefka (2:43)</li><li>Mt.

"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Final Fantasy IV for the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a> is a complete remake of the <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\">original version</a> of the game originally released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The DS version was rebuilt from the ground up using the engine originally created by <a href=\"/matrix-software/3010-3256/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3256\">Matrix Software</a> for the DS remake of <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iii/3030-31147/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31147\">Final Fantasy III</a>. The game follows the same storyline as that of the original version, but is retold with an all-new translation, <a href=\"/3d/3015-1430/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1430\">3D graphics</a> and FMV cinematics, and voice acting during cutscenes.</p><p>Unlike the SNES version of Final Fantasy IV, there is no \"Easy Type\" edition of the game. The DS version was released in all regions with the same content and level of difficulty.</p><p>A PC version of the Final Fantasy IV remake was released on September 17, 2014.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The story of Final Fantasy IV on the DS is unchanged from previous versions of the game. To learn about the plot, read the Story section of the original <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\">Final Fantasy IV</a> page.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Much of the gameplay is similar to Final Fantasy IV. Read the Gameplay section of the original <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\">Final Fantasy IV</a> page for more details. However, there are also some significant changes made for the DS version, and these include:</p><h3>Difficulty</h3><p>Though difficult to specifically catalog, Final Fantasy IV on DS sports notably more difficult battles than the previous versions. Enemies seem to hit harder, drop less gold, and offer fewer experience points. Certain creatures have also developed new habits that render them more difficult to fight, such as the Antlion, who sports a new, vicious counter-attack on top of its standard counter.</p><h3>Augments</h3><p>While in previous versions, a large number of abilities were exclusive to one particular character, the DS remake allows abilities to be learnt by any character through augments. Augments can be collected through story-based events, by revisiting an old dungeon or town, by completing sidequests, or by other means. Characters can learn as many augments as the player gives them, though only four abilities can be active in battle at any one time per character, not including the auto-battle feature. The fifth slot goes to items.</p><h3>Namingway</h3><p>Namingway no longer has the ability to change character names. Instead, he is now the focus of a new series of sidequests, in which the player must hunt him down in various locations as the game progresses. The player is rewarded with a few augments. His appearance has also been changed to that of a rabbit.</p><h3>Whyt</h3><p><a href=\"/rydia/3005-937/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-937\">Rydia</a> gains a new <a href=\"/eidolon/3015-5069/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5069\">Eidolon</a> named Whyt. This Eidolon is unique in that he fights in Rydia's place, and that his stats and abilities can be improved by performing well in a collection of new <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">minigames</a>. The player can also customize Whyt's face by drawing him a new one with the stylus. Whyt's family lives in the Feymarch, the land of the Eidolons.</p><h3>Maps</h3><p>While exploring dungeons, the bottom DS screen typically displays an empty map that automatically fills in as the player wanders around unexplored areas of the floor. When the map for the floor is complete, the player receives a small reward. Uncovering each map of each dungeon in the entire game will yield the Treasure Hunter augment.</p><h3>Fat Chocobo</h3><p>The Fat Chocobo is no longer used to store excess items. Instead, the player may summon him in certain areas to access the game's bestiary, listen to the game's soundtrack, or view previously seen cutscenes.</p><h3>New Game Plus</h3><p>A <a href=\"/new-game-plus/3015-150/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-150\">New Game Plus</a> option is available upon completion of the game, allowing the player to start a new playthrough but with several things carrying over and the offer of fighting two new special bosses. The following are carried over from the previous playthrough:</p><ul><li><b>Rare items</b>: These include dark matter, tails, armor from tails, and any unused apples and soma drops.</li><li><b>Augments</b>: Unused augments will remain in the inventory (this includes the Limit Break augment given as a reward for finishing the game); used ones will remain applied to all of the characters.</li><li><b>Namingway sidequests</b>: Any progress made on the Namingway sidequests is saved.</li><li><b>Map completion</b>: Map completion statistics are retained.</li><li><b>Fat Chocobo statistics</b>: The bestiary and minigame scores are all retained.</li><li><b>Item drop summons</b>: Summons dropped by enemies are kept.</li></ul><p>Everything else is not carried over. This includes gil, levels, and every other inventory item. Because the Namingway sidequests and map completion stats are saved, this means that rewards and augments from these can only be obtained once. However, the player can collect every other augment again.</p><h3>Optional Bosses</h3><p>There are two \"superboss\" fights available in a New Game Plus playthrough: Geryon and Proto-Babil. Geryon can only be fought after defeating the four archfiends in the Giant of Babil. To confront the boss, either examine the space where the archfiends were in the Giant of Babil or the tombstone in the summit of <a href=\"/mount-ordeals/3035-2406/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2406\">Mount Ordeals</a>.</p><p>The second boss, Proto-Babil, requires dark matter - an item only obtained by stealing from the final boss - to be used on the face-like rock on the moon's surface.</p><h2>Cutscenes</h2><p>Final Fantasy IV on the DS presents key events of its story in a significantly different way by showing fully rendered cutscenes with voice acting. These events include:</p><p><i>Warning: This list contains major spoilers.</i></p><ul><li>Cecil's return from Mysidia</li><li>Cecil and Rosa's conversation before <a href=\"/mist/3035-2136/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2136\">Mist</a></li><li>Cecil and Kain arriving at Mist</li><li>Inside Damcyan Castle</li><li>Edward in Kaipo at night</li><li>Meeting Yang on the way to Fabul</li><li>Fabul's Crystal chamber</li><li>Leviathan's appearance</li><li>Cecil becoming a paladin</li><li>Palom and Porom saving Cecil's party</li><li>Kain proposing an exchange</li><li>Golbez's second encounter</li><li>Yang destroying the cannons</li><li>The escape from the underworld</li><li>Edge confronting Rubicante</li><li>The Lunar Whale appearing</li><li>Entering the Giant of Babil</li><li>Confronting the four archfiends</li><li>The Golbez revelation</li><li>Traveling to the moon the final time</li><li>Fighting Zemus</li><li>The aftermath of killing Zeromus</li></ul>",

Although given a <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iii/3030-31147/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31147\">3D remake</a> on the <a href=\"/nintendo-ds/3045-52/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-52\">Nintendo DS</a> in 2006, the original NES version has never been published outside of Japan in any officially licensed form. <a href=\"/final-fantasy-vi/3030-6336/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6336\">Final Fantasy VI</a>, when it was eventually released in the U.S., would end up being re-branded as \"Final Fantasy III\" as it was only the third in the series to be published in the states, despite being a completely different game on the <a href=\"/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638345-474993-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-on-the-world-maps.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2638345\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638345-474993-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-on-the-world-maps.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2638345\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638345-474993-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-on-the-world-maps.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638345-474993-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-on-the-world-maps.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a></figure><p>The game is set in the<a href=\"/floating-island/3015-1560/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1560\"> floating continent</a>, and puts players in control of four orphans raised by an elder named Topopa in the village of Ur. After an earthquake opens up a hidden cavern in the Altar Cave just outside of their village, the orphans set out to explore what lies within. What they find is a crystal of light which grants them each a portion of its power and instructs them to restore balance to the world.</p><p>In the past when the Light was threatening to overtake the world 4 Dark Warriors emerged and cut a swath of destruction. In the present these characters now work for the Light, hopefully to once again restore balance to a world now threatened by the <a href=\"/xande/3005-5192/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5192\">Xande</a> and the <a href=\"/cloud-of-darkness/3005-5124/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5124\"><em>Cloud of Darkness</em></a>--a nihilistic mastermind behind the world’s descent, and the game’s ultimate foe.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay of Final Fantasy III is a mixture of both previous titles in the series, with several additions. Common staples of the series and genre in general such as an <a href=\"/overworld/3015-1004/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\">overworld map</a>, <a href=\"/random-encounter/3015-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-123\">random encounters</a>, <a href=\"/dungeon-crawling/3015-165/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-165\">dungeon crawling</a> and numerous <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\">boss battles</a> all remain prevalent, and central to the game's core experience. New features however, such as <a href=\"/summoning/3015-99/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-99\">summons</a> and the removal of others like the <a href=\"/active-time-battle/3015-95/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-95\">active time battle</a> system, make the game distinct in comparison.</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638346-474987-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-battle-s.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2638346\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638346-474987-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-battle-s.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2638346\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638346-474987-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-battle-s.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638346-474987-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-battle-s.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a></figure><p>Combat in the game is primarily turn-based as was the case with both the earlier games, only without the ATB system. The biggest technical improvement over the original system however is the inclusion of an auto-targeting mechanic for physical attacks which frees players from having to worry about missing a hit completely because the enemy had been killed in a previously queued battle command. This would also later be applied to magical attacks in subsequent games. Another change lies in the graphical display of damage to characters which instead of being shown as a caption, instead are shown above the respective characters' sprites.</p><h3>Experience &amp; Jobs</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638347-474988-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-item-equipment-stats-menus.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2638347\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638347-474988-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-item-equipment-stats-menus.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2638347\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638347-474988-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-item-equipment-stats-menus.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638347-474988-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-item-equipment-stats-menus.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638347-474988-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-item-equipment-stats-menus.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/105400/2638347-474988-final-fantasy-iii-nes-screenshot-item-equipment-stats-menus.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Although scrapped as a feature in Final Fantasy II, the <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience system</a> introduced in the first game makes a return, along with a completely re-tooled <a href=\"/classes/3015-405/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-405\">character class</a> system also absent from the second game which would prove to be permanent fixtures in the series.</p><p>In Final Fantasy III, players are given a \"<a href=\"/job-system/3015-298/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-298\">job system</a>\" which essentially allows characters to switch between different classes at any time. Although all four of the player characters begin as a rudimentary class named \"Onion Knight\", additional and more complex classes are unlocked throughout the game by collecting crystals and can be applied to any of the four characters so long as they have saved enough \"capacity points\" acquired through battle to do so.</p><p>As players earn experience, they also become more proficient with whatever job they have currently equipped. Higher level jobs increase battle statistics of characters, reduce the cost of switching to the job, and increase the effectiveness of specialised weaponry, armor, accessories and spells utilized by the class. Jobs also allow characters to use special innate abilities like the Thief's ability to open secret passages, or battle commands such as Steal which allows players to gain extra loot from battles.</p><h3>Summons</h3><p>Final Fantasy III is the first game in the series to feature creatures which can be summoned at any time to deal high-level damage to enemies. Summons can be bought in stores, but also defeated in combat and bent to the party’s service. Several of these creatures include <a href=\"/shiva/3005-11811/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11811\">Shiva</a>, <a href=\"/ifrit/3005-2883/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2883\">Ifrit</a> and <a href=\"/bahamut/3005-1744/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1744\">Bahamut</a>. Similarly, this is the first in the series to feature friendly helper creatures named <a href=\"/moogles/3015-497/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-497\">moogles</a>, a now prominent staple of the franchise.</p><p> </p>",

"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Final Fantasy Dimensions is an enhanced port of the Japan-only episodic cellphone game Final Fantasy Legends: Warriors of Light and Dark. Warriors of Light and Dark was released in chapters from late 2010 to late 2011 at a rate of roughly one per month. For the Dimensions version, the chapters are being sold in bundles. The game was released on August 31, 2012.</p><p>Compared to the original version, Dimensions has a completely remastered soundtrack, upgraded visuals, new touch controls, and when all bundles are purchased, the expected total cost will be lower. All totaled, Warriors of Light and Dark cost around $60 when all of the game's content was purchased.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Long ago, when the entire world was crumbling from war, the Avalon Empire rose up and brought an end to the conflict, ushering in a golden age of peace. However, after one of the crystals is shattered and the others begin to behave strangely, the world is plunged into a new conflict. Over the course of the story, the player will control two different groups, each with their own agenda; the Light Warriors lead by Sol and Dark Warriors lead by Nacht.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2238911-e04d6e9d16dbb6d9436c92a32d21cef31339350576_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2238911\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66612903225806\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2238911-e04d6e9d16dbb6d9436c92a32d21cef31339350576_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2238911\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2238911-e04d6e9d16dbb6d9436c92a32d21cef31339350576_full.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1992/2238911-e04d6e9d16dbb6d9436c92a32d21cef31339350576_full.jpg 620w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1992/2238911-e04d6e9d16dbb6d9436c92a32d21cef31339350576_full.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1992/2238911-e04d6e9d16dbb6d9436c92a32d21cef31339350576_full.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>This game uses a five-person party with eight main party members divided into the two teams. For most of the game, players will swap between parties of Sol's four Warriors of Light and Nacht's four Warriors of Darkness. There are an additional ten characters that will swap in and out of the player's parties over the course of the game.</p><p>After the prologue, each chapter features three to twelve dungeons, several side quests, and a post-chapter challenge dungeon. To maintain balance from one chapter to the next, levels and job levels are capped within each chapter. Players can hit a chapter's level cap and find all of the best equipment available and enter the subsequent chapter without being overpowered.</p><h2>Job System</h2><p>The game uses a Job system similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21463\" href=\"/final-fantasy-iii/3030-21463/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-iii\">Final Fantasy III</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4793\" href=\"/final-fantasy-v/3030-4793/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-v\">Final Fantasy V</a>. As the player's characters level up jobs, they will be able to switch to new jobs while retaining the abilities of their prior jobs. Eight jobs are available when the game begins. These jobs are:</p><ul><li>Black Mage</li><li>Freelancer</li><li>Monk</li><li>Red Mage</li><li>Summoner</li><li>Thief</li><li>Warrior</li><li>White Mage</li></ul><p>As players progress through the episodes, more jobs will be unlocked. The Warriors of Darkness will gain access to the Dancer, Dark Knight, Magus, Ninja, and Ranger jobs. The Warriors of Light, on the other hand, will gain access to the Bard, Devout, Dragoon, Knight and Memorist occupations.</p>",

It follows many of the traditions of the series while experimenting with new ideas. As opposed to the previous game, which featured nearly no character customization, Final Fantasy V had an open-ended \"job\" system which allowed characters to be customized with different roles, and even use one role's abilities while in another one. The execution was similar to the one that <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21463\" href=\"/final-fantasy-iii/3030-21463/\">Final Fantasy III</a> had, although less rigid.</p><h2>Release</h2><p>As originally released, Final Fantasy V only came out for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-9\" href=\"/snes/3045-9/\">Super Famicom</a> in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-37\" href=\"/japan/3035-37/\">Japan</a>. Due to worries from the project team that the game wouldn't be accessible to the average gamer, the translation of Final Fantasy V was shelved, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6336\" href=\"/final-fantasy-vi/3030-6336/\">Final Fantasy VI</a> was translated into American and European regions as \"Final Fantasy III\" instead. English-speaking countries did not see an official release until the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-22\" href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\">PlayStation</a> port, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30783\" href=\"/final-fantasy-anthology/3030-30783/\">Final Fantasy Anthology</a>, was released nearly seven years later, on September 30, 1999. Another version, this time ported to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-4\" href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\">Game Boy Advance</a>, was released on November 6, 2006. It has also seen a release in Japan on <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36/\">Nintendo's Wii</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\" href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\">Virtual Console</a> in January 2011 and on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2623\" href=\"/playstation-network/3015-2623/\">PSN</a> as a PSOne Classic on April 6th. A European and North American release has been confirmed as a PSOne classic.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The story begins as the winds across the worlds begin to slow, bringing ships to a halt. King Tycoon, on the back of his dragon Hiryuu, sets off to the wind shrine to investigate the matter. When the dragon arrives, the crystal shatters, stopping the wind. As this happens, a meteorite plunges into the ground near Tycoon castle, and close to the spot where <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1135\" href=\"/bartz-klauser/3005-1135/\">Bartz</a> and his <a data-ref-id=\"3015-259\" href=\"/chocobo/3015-259/\">chocobo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1973\" href=\"/boko/3005-1973/\">Boko</a>, are relaxing. Bartz and Boko set off to investigate the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3722\" href=\"/asteroid-impact/3015-3722/\">meteorite</a>, where they encounter a young girl named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1068\" href=\"/lenna-charlotte-tycoon/3005-1068/\">Lenna</a>, under attack by some monsters. Bartz saves her, and the two investigate further. They encounter someone else at the site, an old man named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1208\" href=\"/galuf-halm-baldesion/3005-1208/\">Galuf</a>. Unfortunately, his name is the only thing he remembers. As the three talk, Lenna tells them that she was traveling to the wind shrine, where her father was. Galuf realizes that he must go to the wind shrine! Of course, he doesn't know why. With that, the three of them set off for the wind shrine.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4248/256476-tn_565_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-256476\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 565px\" data-ratio=\"0.66548672566372\" data-width=\"565\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4248/256476-tn_565_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-256476\"><img alt=\"The Water Crystal\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4248/256476-tn_565_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4248/256476-tn_565_1.jpg 565w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4248/256476-tn_565_1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The Water Crystal</figcaption></figure><p>The meteorite proves to be quite the obstacle, requiring the trio to travel by sea. They recruit the help of pirate captain <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1136\" href=\"/faris-scherwiz/3005-1136/\">Faris Scherwiz</a>, who takes them to the shrine. When they arrive, the situation is bleak. King Tycoon is nowhere to be seen, and the crystal is shattered. The shards of crystal magically react, and an image of the king appears. He tells them they are chosen warriors who are tasked with protecting the crystals from an ancient evil.</p><p>Further research reveals that the evil King Tycoon spoke of is the great warlock <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1202\" href=\"/exdeath/3005-1202/\">Exdeath</a>. Exdeath had once tried to destroy the world, but was sealed using the crystals. Now, these crystals were being used for their power, and it was being drained, weakening the seal on Exdeath. If Exdeath escapes and the crystals are destroyed, it would mean certain doom, unleashing a great evil and making their world uninhabitable. The four warriors now have their work cut out for them, they must save the crystals of fire, water, and earth from the fate of the wind crystal.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1981/185009-ff_main_boko_and_bartz.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-185009\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 240px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1981/185009-ff_main_boko_and_bartz.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-185009\"><img alt=\"Bartz, the main character and his chocobo Boko.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1981/185009-ff_main_boko_and_bartz.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1981/185009-ff_main_boko_and_bartz.png 240w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bartz, the main character and his chocobo Boko.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1981/185009-ff_main_boko_and_bartz.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1981/185009-ff_main_boko_and_bartz.png 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bartz, the main character and his chocobo Boko.</figcaption></figure><p>Just after encountering Faris, the party notices something odd. Everyone in his crew finds him very attractive, and Bartz does too. An awkward situation. It turns out, there is reason for this: Faris is a woman! Later on, Lenna discovers that Faris is her once thought to be lost sister, the princess of Tycoon!</p><p>They travel to Walse, Karnak, and Carwen, and ultimately fail to save any of the crystals. Each one shatters as the team arrives, however, they harvest their power in hopes of saving the next crystal. While in Karnak, attempting to save the fire crystal, they meet <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8161\" href=\"/krile-mayer-baldesion/3005-8161/\">Krile</a>. Krile has come from another world, looking for Galuf, who is her grandfather! Krile is the key to Galuf's memory, and her arrival brings a flood of knowledge. Galuf is from another world, and with his new memory, he and Krile depart to their home.</p><p>Bartz, Lenna, and Faris return to consult with the geniuses Cid and Mid at the library of the ancients. What should they do next? They resolve that they must travel to Galuf's world, and save it from Exdeath. Exdeath wants to destroy that world, not this one, and they feel they must help. With the help of Cid and Mid, they travel across worlds.</p><p>The party arrives at Exdeath's castle, where an intense battle is taken place. The three end up as captives of Exdeath, and are locked up. Galuf comes to their rescue, and the team makes haste. They run across the big bridge, and enounter the great <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1189\" href=\"/gilgamesh/3005-1189/\">Gilgamesh</a>, who vows to stop them. They take him on and defeat him, and as they escape, the castle's barrier is activated, sending them flying across the planet. Galuf reveals that he is king of Bal, a great city in this world, and was once one of the great warriors who sealed Exdeath. a shock to Bartz and the gang. They set off for Bal, and get there with Krile and her wind drake's help.</p><p>Unfortunately, the wind drake is dying, and the only cure is dragon grass. The four warriors set off to find some. They meet up with an old comrade of Galuf's, one of the great warriors, Kelger. Kelger reveals to Bartz that his father, who had once left him, was one of the legendary warriors who had once fought with Galuf and Kelger. They travel further, and obtain dragon grass, and heal the drake.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390625-79729_1_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390625\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 240px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"240\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390625-79729_1_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390625\"><img alt=\"Boss Battle\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390625-79729_1_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390625-79729_1_2.jpg 240w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Boss Battle\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390625-79729_1_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390625-79729_1_2.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" data-width=\"240\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Boss Battle</figcaption></figure><p>In order to progress further, the team seeks the wisdom of the great sage Ghido. Ghido had warned of the destruction of the crystals before, and could likely recommend a course of action for defeating Exdeath. Misfortune strikes, however, and when the party arrives, Ghido's island sinks into the ocean thanks to Exdeath. Still determined, they seek another way to reach Ghido. The team meets up with the other of the original four warriors, Xezat, and his navy fleet sailing to attack Exdeath. With Xezat's help, they infiltrate and take down the barrier surrounding the castle. Unfortunately, Xezat sacrifices himself in the process. They obtain a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-828\" href=\"/submarine/3055-828/\">submarine</a>, and set off for Ghido's cave.</p><p>They traverse the underwater cave, and meet the old turtle sage Ghido. Ghido tells them that Exdeath was once a mage named Enuo, who had control over the void. When he was defeated, his evil was sealed in the trees of the Forest of Moore, where after 1,000 years, his evil broke the seal and was reborn into the world as the being known as Exdeath. The party then sets out to the forest to try and find something to help them destroy Exdeath.</p><p>They travel to and through the forest, and reach the tree. Exdeath, bent on stopping them, shows up to spoil the party. He immobilizes them, and all hope seems lost. Krile arrives in the nick of time to save them, however, she proves no match for Exdeath. Determined, Galuf breaks free of Exdeaths spell, and takes Exdeath on head to head. Galuf fights until Exdeath retreats, when Galuf collapses. Bartz, Krile, Lenna, and Faris rush to his side, but he passes on. His spirit passes</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390641-79729_17_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390641\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 242px\" data-ratio=\"0.66528925619835\" data-width=\"242\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390641-79729_17_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-390641\"><img alt=\"A regular random encounter\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\" data-width=\"242\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390641-79729_17_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390641-79729_17_2.jpg 242w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A regular random encounter\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390641-79729_17_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/390641-79729_17_2.jpg 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\" data-width=\"242\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A regular random encounter</figcaption></figure><p>on his power to Krile, who joins our warriors, now out to get Exdeath once and for all.</p><p>The group heads straight for Exdeath's castle, climb up, and face him in battle. They defeat him, but it is too late. Exdeath accomplishes his goal, and two worlds - Bartz's world and Glauf's - fuse together. The group once again seeks Ghido's counsel, and he advises they collect all of the legendary weapons. The group travels far and wide, breaking the seals on the weapons, and taking each one. Once this task is completed, they head for the rift. They meet Gilgamesh one final time, who gives them his friendship. They go further into the rift, where Exdeath has gained the power of the void, and reveals his true form: a monstrous tree. He shows his true form, Neo Exdeath, and the final battle begins.</p><h2>Jobs</h2><p>The main gameplay feature that Final Fantasy V is remembered for is its open-ended \"Job\" system. Unlike most games in the series, each character can be assigned to perform any role the player desires, whether that be <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3518\" href=\"/spellcaster/3015-3518/\">spellcaster</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-135\" href=\"/dual-wielding/3015-135/\">dual-wielding</a> ninja, or hard to kill knight. At the start of the game, six classes, some based on classic Final Fantasy archetypes ( <a data-ref-id=\"3015-211\" href=\"/hume-black-mage/3015-211/\">Black Mage</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-212\" href=\"/hume-white-mage/3015-212/\">White Mage</a>, Thief) are given to the player, and a total of 22 are gradually unlocked over the course of the game. Each of these Jobs comes with various advantages and disadvantages; spellcasters are typically weaker, but their ability to cast magic can make them very useful, while classes such as Thief are more adept at subtle advantages (like stealing from enemies) rather than sheer damage dealing.</p><p>As characters gain the traditional experience levels, they also gain AP, which serve as a sort of \"Job experience point\" system. As a character levels up their experience in a Job, they unlock various abilities that can then be used while the character is using another class, an example being casting Black Magic while the character is a White Mage, thereby allowing one character to serve both offensive and defensive roles. Characters are limited as to how many abilities they can have equipped at once, however, requiring strategic choices by the player to get past different points in the game.</p><p>A few of the character types introduced in Final Fantasy V have become staple elements of future games. The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-775\" href=\"/hume-blue-mage/3015-775/\">Blue Mage</a> is the most prominent, with his ability to learn attacks that enemies have used on him being present in just about every game in the series since, and the concept of Time Mage has lived on in most games since, providing a category for spells like Slow and Haste which were previously placed with Black and White Magic, respectively.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1759763-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759763\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 225px\" data-ratio=\"0.96444444444444\" data-width=\"225\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1759763-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759763\"><img alt=\"Main characters as white mages\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1759763-1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1759763-1.png 225w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Main characters as white mages\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1759763-1.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1759763-1.png 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Main characters as white mages</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Knight</li><li>Monk</li><li>Thief</li><li>Lancer</li><li>Ninja</li><li>Samurai</li><li>Berserker</li><li>Sorcerer</li><li>White Mage</li><li>Black Mage</li><li>Time Mage</li><li>Summoner</li><li>Blue Mage</li><li>Red Mage</li><li>Trainer</li><li>Chemist</li><li>Geomancer</li><li>Bard</li><li>Dancer</li><li>Mime</li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>Disc 1</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1759764-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759764\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 588px\" data-ratio=\"0.85034013605442\" data-width=\"588\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:85.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1759764-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1759764\"><img alt=\"Soundtrack cover art\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1759764-1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1759764-1.jpg 588w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1759764-1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1759764-1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Soundtrack cover art\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1759764-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/1759764-1.jpg 588w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/1759764-1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/1759764-1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Soundtrack cover art</figcaption></figure><p>1.

"description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Final Fantasy X marked the transition of the Final Fantasy franchise from <a href=\"../../playstation/60-22/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PlayStation</a> to the <a href=\"../../playstation-2/60-19/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PlayStation 2</a>. The game was developed and published by Square and was released on December 26, 2001 and was the first of the series to implement fully three-dimensional backgrounds, made possible through the \"Emotion Engine.\" The PlayStation 2's graphical capabilities allowed a higher polygon count and for lighting and shadows to appear more naturally and realistically than prior Final Fantasy games.</p><p>Final Fantasy X is similar to other installments in the franchise; the story of the game follows one base plotline, but contains a variety of smaller conflicts relating to the main goal. Most of which are listed below, for a recap of the important events of Final Fantasy X check out the \"recap\" section.</p><p>In 2011, it was announced that an HD version of the game will be available for <a href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">Playstation Vita</a> &amp; <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">Playstation 3</a>. The latter comes bundled together with the game's sequel, Final Fantasy X-2 as part of the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster/3030-42013/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42013\">Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Final Fantasy X featured a number of significant gameplay changes that set it apart from previous games in the series. First and foremost was the elimination of a world map. Rather than roam the world from an overhead perspective, <a href=\"../../spira/95-221/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spira</a> is explored from a behind-the-back perspective that is mostly kept on a straight-forward track with little deviation in the path from start to finish. The majority of battles in the game take place as <a href=\"../../random-encounter/92-123/\" rel=\"nofollow\">random encounters</a>.</p><h3>Combat</h3><p>Final Fantasy X's combat system is a strict <a href=\"../../turn-based/92-192/\" rel=\"nofollow\">turn-based</a> affair in which turn order is determined by the speed of the individual characters. To help the player plan ahead, the battle screen features a chart that displays which characters will act in the upcoming turns. The active battle team is limited to three characters, but the player can switch out an active character on their turn to bring in one of the reserves.</p><p>Each party member has a particular specialization that gives them their defining roles in combat:</p><ul><li><a href=\"../../tidus/94-736/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tidus</a> is a speedy fighter that can use time magic such as Haste and Slow. His main weapon is a sword and his overdrive ability is Swordplay.</li><li><a href=\"../../yuna/94-829/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yuna</a> is both the party's White Mage and Summoner. She is able to equip staffs and summons her aeons in overdrive using her own overdrive ability Grand Summon.</li><li><a href=\"../../lulu/94-744/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lulu</a> is the party Black Mage that can cast the majority of the game's attack spells. She wields various puppets resembling characters from previous FF games as her weapon and when she hits overdrive she is able to use her Fury ability.</li><li><a href=\"../../auron/94-1268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Auron</a> is a pure physical fighter that deals high damage. He uses larger heavier swords than Tidus and has the Bushido overdrive ability.</li><li><a href=\"../../wakka/94-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wakka</a> has an advantage against aerial enemies. His weapon of choice is a blitz ball which he powers up with his Slots overdrive.</li><li><a href=\"../../rikku/94-1265/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rikku</a> is an agile thief-like character that can steal from enemies. She wear various gloves to aid her in fighting and blends items together with her Mix overdrive. Rikku also has an advantage against small machina enemies and can easily dismantle them.</li><li><a href=\"../../kimahri/94-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kimahri</a> has the Blue Mage ability to learn certain enemy attacks that are used against him with his Lancet ability. He wields large spears and uses his Ronso Rage when in overdrive.</li></ul><p>The key to using the game's combat system effectively lies in the ability to switch characters in and out to take advantage of their strengths and enemy weaknesses.</p><h3>Sphere Grid</h3><p>Final Fantasy X does away with the traditional method of accruing <a href=\"../../experience-points/92-39/\" rel=\"nofollow\">experience points</a> to gain levels and automatically earn stat boosts and abilities. Instead, it introduces the concept of the Sphere Grid; a field of points linked together by tracks. Each character begins at a different point on the grid, and by earning the game's equivalent of experience points, the player is gradually able to advance the characters to each point on the tracks. To unlock stat boosts and new abilities, the player must expend special sphere items such as Power Spheres and Speed Spheres in order to gain the boosts provided by the spaces on the grid.</p><p>When the player starts the game, each character is cordoned off in their designated areas of the Sphere Grid, but with the proper Key Spheres, it is possible to open up other areas of the Sphere Grid to each character. This allows, for example, Lulu or Auron to learn white magic abilities, while Yuna and Tidus could gain the strength boosts and combat abilities of Auron's track.</p><h3>Overdrive</h3><p>Much like limit breaks from the two previous installments, Final Fantasy X has unique powerful attacks for each characters called Overdrives. Initially, the Overdrive gauges for each character build up as the characters take damage, but the player will eventually unlock alternative battle actions to build gauge energy. (For example, defeating enemies, inflicting damage, or even healing).</p><p>Each character's Overdrive is tied specifically to him or her and cannot be learned by the other party members. Each Overdrive also has unique gameplay mechanics that affect the amount of damage inflicted. For example, Auron's Bushido Overdrive requires that the player input a specific button sequence for the full effect. Additionally, each of Yuna's summons have their own Overdrive gauges and abilities. If Yuna uses her Grand Summon Overdrive, she can immediately call forth a summon to use its own Overdrive regardless of whether or not its Overdrive gauge was filled before the Grand Summon was invoked.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Final Fantasy X begins <i>in medias res</i> with the protagonist, Tidus, looking out over a ruined <a href=\"../../zanarkand/95-248/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zanarkand</a> City, as he starts to narrate the events that led him and his companions there. His story begins just before a much anticipated <a href=\"../../blitzball/92-966/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blitzball</a> game, in an unharmed Zanarkand City, where Tidus lives and is a famous star of the sport. During the Blitzball game, <a href=\"../../sin/94-1970/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sin</a> attacks the city, sucking up both Tidus and his father's family-friend, <a href=\"../../auron/94-1268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Auron</a>.</p><p>Tidus awakes alone in the ruins of an unknown deserted temple, where he meets a group of Al Bhed salvages. One of whom is Rikku; through her Tidus learns that Zanarkand was destroyed by Sin a thousand years ago. Tidus helps the Al Bhed with the recovery of a large sunken <a href=\"../../airship/93-154/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Airship</a> just before they are again attacked by Sin.</p><p>Tidus wakes up alone for a second time, having washed up on a beach on the island of <a href=\"../../besaid-island/95-828/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Besaid</a>. Tidus meets the captain of a Blitzball team Wakka as he arrives to shore and quickly impresses him with his Blitzball skills. Wakka introduces Tidus to Yuna, an apprentice summoner who plans to make a pilgrimage to the ruins of Zanarkand, as her father did ten years before her. At Zanarkand, she would summon the \"Final Aeon\" and temporarily destroy Sin, bringing about a ten year long \"Calm.\" Tidus also meets Yuna's guardians; Lulu and Kimahri, whom along with Wakka would travel with Yuna on her journey. Yuna acquires the first aeon, Valefor, in Besaid's temple to begin her pilgrimage and Wakka asks Tidus to accompany them part of the way to Luca, to search for anyone he knows and to play for the Besaid Aurochs in an upcoming tournament.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/324356-sina_sea.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-324356\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/324356-sina_sea.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-324356\"><img alt=\"Sin attacks en route to Kilika\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/867/324356-sina_sea.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/324356-sina_sea.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/867/324356-sina_sea.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Sin attacks en route to Kilika</figcaption></figure><p>The party sail to <a href=\"../../kilika-island/95-818/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kilika</a> Island and are attacked by Sin at sea; after the group repel Sin, it turns to Kilika Island, killing most of it's population. The party arrive safely at the destroyed Kilika to make the second stop on Yuna's pilgrimage, with Yuna acquiring the second aeon, <a href=\"../../ifrit/94-2883/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ifrit</a>. They continue on to <a href=\"../../luca/95-925/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luca</a>, where the stadium is attacked by fiends after the blitzball tournament. They are fought by <a href=\"../../seymour-guado/94-1228/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seymour Guado</a> and his aeon, Anima, and destroyed. Tidus finds Auron in Luca shortly afterwards, who informs the group that he plans to join them as a permanent guardian on their pilgrimage, causing Tidus to effectively do the same.</p><p>The group continue their journey, encountering Sin and it's devastating effect on the world once again, before making the next stop on the pilgrimage to get the third aeon, <a href=\"../../ixion/94-3815/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ixion</a>. They continue onwards and come across a disguised Al Bhed, who quickly reveals herself to be Rikku, and Yuna's cousin. They arrive at <a href=\"../../guadosalam/95-831/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guadosalam</a>, where Seymour proposes to Yuna before leaving for <a href=\"../../macalania/95-966/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Macalania</a> Temple. Whilst traveling to the temple though the <a href=\"../../thunder-plains/95-1301/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thunder Plains</a>, Yuna tells her guardians that she will marry Seymour for the sake of public happiness.</p><p>At the temple, Yuna finds a sphere recorded by Seymour's father, Jyscal, detailing the malcontent and hate his son possessed. In this recording he accurately predicted his own murder at the hands of his son. After receiving the fourth aeon, <a href=\"../../shiva/94-2884/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shiva</a>, from the temple, the group fight and kill Seymour. After fleeing the temple the group are again attacked by Sin, this time transporting all of them to different locations on the sandy, desert-like <a href=\"../../bikanel-island/95-918/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bikanel Island</a>, home of the Al Bhed.</p><p>The party regroups, minus one member, after being unable to find Yuna. Rikku leads the group to the Al Bhed Home to find it under attack from Yevon's forces; the Al Bhed had been kidnapping summoners to prevent them from summoning the Final Aeon. It is here that Tidus learns that the Final Summoning will kill any summoner who performs it, including Yuna. Cid, Rikku's father, was determined to save Yuna, who had been taken to Bevelle to be forcefully married to the dead, but unsent, Seymour.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/324358-wedding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-324358\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/324358-wedding.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-324358\"><img alt=\"The Wedding\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/867/324358-wedding.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/324358-wedding.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/867/324358-wedding.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>The Wedding</figcaption></figure><p>The party travel to <a href=\"../../bevelle/95-919/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bevelle</a> on the airship salvaged at the beginning of the game and gatecrash the wedding in progress, stealing back Yuna and escaping to the Temple of Bevelle. There, Yuna acquires the fifth aeon, <a href=\"../../bahamut/94-1744/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bahamut</a>, before the entire party defeat Seymour in battle a second time. After a romantic embrace between Tidus and Yuna the party travel through the <a href=\"../../calm-lands/95-1302/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Calm Lands</a> and onto <a href=\"../../mt-gagazet/95-1305/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mt. Gagazet</a>, the Ronso homeland. Halfway up the mountain, Kimahri encounters members of his old tribe, who tell him to turn back, as he was banished from the mountain long ago. Kimahri fights his tribesmen, Biran and Yenke, defeating them and earning their respect. When the party reach the summit, they encounter a flying Seymour and learn that he had slaughtered the entire Ronso tribe behind him. The group defeat Seymour for a third time and continue down the mountainside toward the ruins of Zanarkand.</p><p>Before reaching the bottom of the mountain, Tidus learns that he, his father, <a href=\"../../jecht/94-1857/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jecht</a>, and the Zanarkand they had known are dream-like entities created by Yevon, the real Zanarkand's ancient ruler. It is after this that the party reach the bottom of the mountain and ends Tidus' prolonged flashback sequence, which had begun at the beginning of the game. Inside the Temple of Zanarkand, the group learn from <a href=\"../../yunalesca/94-6769/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lady Yunalesca</a> that the Final Aeon is created from the spirit and life of one of the summoner's guardians, the last of which had been <a href=\"../../braska/94-1742/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Braska</a>'s guardian, Jecht. A flashback visible to the entire group occurs; showing Auron, ten years ago, attempting to attack Yunalesca for the deaths of Braska and Jecht. Yunalesca kills Auron in this display, revealing to the party that Auron is an Unsent himself.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/324323-airship_beat_sin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-324323\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/324323-airship_beat_sin.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-324323\"><img alt=\"Cid's airship attacking Sin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/867/324323-airship_beat_sin.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/324323-airship_beat_sin.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/867/324323-airship_beat_sin.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cid's airship attacking Sin\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/867/324323-airship_beat_sin.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/324323-airship_beat_sin.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/867/324323-airship_beat_sin.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cid's airship attacking Sin</figcaption></figure><p>Yuna did not wish for any of her companions to be sacrificed, angering Yunalesca and sparking a confrontation.

Soon after landing inside Sin, the party encounters Seymour for a final time, after they defeat him Yuna sends him to the Farplane, ending his life forever.

Many of these hidden gems can be overlooked by players focused on finishing the game instead of soaking up the atmosphere of the world. These next few sections are dedicated to analyzing and pointing out those significant moments that you may have missed.</p><p><u><b>IMPORTANT:</b></u> Sections that contain spoilers will be marked with a *.</p><ul><li>Anything you could find out from reading the manual, or playing the game for three hours is not a spoiler.</li><li>Anything from the introduction sequence of the game will be marked with one * (10 hours in).</li><li>Anything from the middle of the storyline will be marked with two ** (10-32 hours in).</li><li>Anything from the end section of the game will be marked with three *** (32-45 hours in).</li></ul><h2>Character Subplots</h2><p>Final Fantasy X has seven main characters that the player can control throughout the game. Each character has fully developed personalities. Every character has unique conflicts that they fight through for the duration of the game's story. This next section covers each of the seven characters and the unique subplots that they have. For the sake of organization each entry will have the first initial of the character's name so no one gets confused. So:</p><p><b>T</b><b>idus</b> = (T)</p><p><b>Auron</b> = (A)</p><p><b>Rikku</b> = (R)</p><p><b>W</b><b>akka</b> = (W)</p><p><b>Lulu</b> = (L)</p><p><b>Yuna</b> = (Y)</p><p><b>Kimahri</b> (K)</p><h3>(T) Zanarkand</h3><p>Tidus' hometown Zanarkand, is believed to have been destroyed a thousand years ago according to the religion of Spira: Yevon. Tidus obviously has some trouble believing this since the prolouge of the game takes place in Zanarkand on the day of the assumed destruction of the city. Zanarkand serves as the driving force for Tidus for the majority of the game. He tags along with Yuna and her guardians so he can find Auron, and he only wants to find Auron so he can figure out how to get back to Zanarkand. When Tidus learns that Yuna's destination is Zanarkand, he sticks with the crew so he can see his home once again.</p><p>This conflict establishes the goal of the story from the very beginning. Players are supposed to wonder whether or not Zanarkand is really destroyed, in the same way that Tidus questions the validity of everyone's story. In addition to being crucial to the creation of the story, Zankarkand also provides a geographically end point to the game. Players are given an idea of where the game will end, and won't have to stress during the final hours of the game bemused by the thought \"is this going to end?\" However Tidus' interests are not exclusive to his hometown...</p><h3>(T) Love Interest - Yuna ***</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1108/206534-monster_s_yuna.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-206534\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1108/206534-monster_s_yuna.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-206534\"><img alt=\"Yuna's timid and kind personality gives players a person they can easily care about\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1108/206534-monster_s_yuna.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1108/206534-monster_s_yuna.png 720w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1108/206534-monster_s_yuna.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1108/206534-monster_s_yuna.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Yuna's timid and kind personality gives players a person they can easily care about\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1108/206534-monster_s_yuna.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1108/206534-monster_s_yuna.png 720w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1108/206534-monster_s_yuna.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1108/206534-monster_s_yuna.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yuna's timid and kind personality gives players a person they can easily care about</figcaption></figure><p>Yuna is introduced halfway through Tidus' progression on Besaid Island. Tidus is instantly attracted to her due to her beauty and approachable demeanor. The relationship that forms between Tidus and Yuna over-arcs the entire storyline; despite nothing serious occurring between the two until the tale end of the game, characters and party members poke fun at their high-school relationship the entire game. Tidus initially starts talking to Yuna because she seems very friendly, and is the only other character of the cast who is close to Tidus' age.</p><p>Although the relationship is very tamed physically, Tidus and Yuna show signs of interest in one another in a few key points of the story. The first being Yuna's suggestion that Tidus join her group of guardians. This act can be seen as Yuna trying to express her feelings for Tidus, but at the same time when taking in consideration her kind, philanthropist look on life, she also most likely just wanted Tidus to find his home again. The second sign is much further down the line during a pinnacle scene at the destruction of the Al Bhed haven, Home. Tidus learns that Yuna will die when she summons the final aeon that will defeat Sin, Tidus is enraged by this fact, and swears that he'll find a way so that she won't have to die. This act is more self-centered when compared to Yuna's, but that mirrors Tidus' personality correctly.</p><p>Near the final hours of the game, Tidus is informed of what The Fayth are capable of when he discovers he is an figment that The Fayth created, and doesn't actually exist. After this point, Tidus begins to develop a more mature and understanding outlook on life.</p><h3>(T) Maturation *</h3><p>As the opening cinematic clearly states: this is Tidus' story. The game follows Tidus' trajectory from being a teenager, to a young adult throughout his experience in the land of Spira. Throughout the course of the game Tidus struggles with several reoccurring conflicts that plague his life:</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6279/266304-tidus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266304\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.2119815668203\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6279/266304-tidus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-266304\"><img alt=\"Tidus' immature personality traits were designed to resonate with the teenagers playing the game\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px\" data-width=\"217\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6279/266304-tidus.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6279/266304-tidus.jpg 217w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tidus' immature personality traits were designed to resonate with the teenagers playing the game\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6279/266304-tidus.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6279/266304-tidus.jpg 217w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 217px) 100vw, 217px\" data-width=\"217\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tidus' immature personality traits were designed to resonate with the teenagers playing the game</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Living in his father's shadow</li><li>His feelings for Yuna</li><li>General understanding of Spira</li></ul><p>Tidus struggles to get away from his father's history. In Zankarkand he is known as \"The Son of Jecht.\" This is because Jecht was a star blitzball player just like Tidus, but is often seen as \"better\" than Tidus since Jecht came first. Things are very similar in the world of Spira as well, since Jecht is known as a great guardian in the land. For this reason he is often referred to as \"The Son of Jecht\" or other possessive nicknames. Tidus' constant nicknames are used for plot and narrative reasons, but also works around the fact that players are allowed to entitle their character whatever they want. The name \"Tidus\" is never spoken in the game's dialogue, allowing players to name their character whatever they want.</p><p>In addition to Jecht, Tidus also tries to figure out how to express his feelings for Yuna, but for more on this check out the \"Love Interest - Yuna\" section. Tidus' general understanding of Spira is a very vague topic that actually stretches over several smaller problems in the world of Spira. For example, death is commonly accepted in the world since Sin terrorizes the cities and villages so frequently. Tidus comes from a Utopian society, so this common acceptance for death and sacrifice is jarring for Tidus initially and has to overcome his gut reaction so he can function properly in his new society. There are several other subtopics such as Racism in the world, that will be mentioned more later.</p><p>Final Fantasy X is primarily a story about maturing from a teenager to young adult. This storyline was picked to help resonate with fans of the Final Fantasy series, and provides a common ground that most people playing the game and relate to. Tidus' struggles may not mirror every player's personal problems, but his issues are ambiguous enough to allow a good deal of imagination to be used so players can relate to the game how they want. However there are several other characters who go through a similar \"coming of age\" tale...</p><h3>(R) Self-Identity**</h3><p>Rikku follows a long progression over the entire game about what type of person she wants to be. She's introduced as the happy and upbeat \"don't worry be happy\" type. However, as the game progresses, Rikku reveals to the other party members that she thinks her optimistic and happy attitude gives some people the impression that she isn't very intelligent. She fantasizes about becoming like Lulu, the black mage of the party. Lulu's demeanor is very serious, and only speaks when she has to.</p><p>Because of her envy for Lulu's personality, Rikku begins to mirror how Lulu would respond to situations instead of herself. She even tries to learn Black Magic spells in order to be viewed in a similar way. After a steady progression of trying harder and harder to be someone she is not, Kimarhi speaks to Rikku and says \"Rikku should be Rikku.\" His few words are further explained by Tidus, who elaborates that each person is built a certain way and instead of trying to change what she is, she should embrace it. Tidus ties this explanation back to the pilgrimage by explaining that someone has to be optimistic when the times are so grim. Rikku takes the advice and continues to being her own-self. Eventually she is able to reveal her more mature thoughts later in the game the more she trusts her fellow party members.</p><h2>International Edition</h2><h3>Primary Changes</h3><p>The main changes from the original Japanese release contains all the updates found in the North American. It maintains an English voice cast while maintaining the same Japanese text. Like all other \"re-releases\" of Square games in japan, this is also considered as the \"final-cut\" of the game. The PAL version of Final Fantasy X could be seen as the only \"English\" release of Final Fantasy X International, as it contains all the following changes, except the Prelude to Final Fantasy X-2.</p><h3>Sphere Grid</h3><p>There's an extra sphere grid which starts the players off in the center of the grid. This will allow all characters to progress however they want. Instead of locking Lulu as a primary \"black mage\", she is free to pick whatever style of play she wants. However, selecting the new Grid will result in less status boosts and overall smaller grid.</p><h3>Dark Aeons</h3><p>During the course of the game, the player is allowed to fight the dark version of Aeons. These are considered some of the most powerful boss fights in the game. It's impossible to defeat the harder Dark Aeons without unlocking every characters Damage Limit and Status Limits. After defeating all the Dark Aeons, the player is allowed to fight the hardest monster of Final Fantasy X, Penance.</p><h3>Prelude to Final Fantasy X-2</h3><p>The Japanese version contains a bonus feature which leads up to the story of Final Fantasy X-2. Called the \"Eternal Calm\", this feature highlights life without Tidus and Yuna understanding the changes of the world. It finally closes with a man who looks like Tidus locked up, and this drives Yuna to find her true love.</p><h3>Bonus DVD</h3><p>Both the Japanese and European versions of Final Fantasy X International. The bonus DVD contains the making of documentary of Final Fantasy X. It also contains interviews with the English voice actors of Tidus and Yuna. The extras of the DVD are some trailers of Final Fantasy X and the music video of the Final Fantasy X love song, \"Suteki Da Ne\" performed by RIKKI.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><h3><b>Disc One</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/379817-ff10_ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-379817\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.83812010443864\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/379817-ff10_ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-379817\"><img alt=\"Final Fantasy X - Original Soundtrack\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/867/379817-ff10_ost.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/379817-ff10_ost.jpg 383w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/867/379817-ff10_ost.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Final Fantasy X - Original Soundtrack\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/867/379817-ff10_ost.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/867/379817-ff10_ost.jpg 383w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/867/379817-ff10_ost.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy X - Original Soundtrack</figcaption></figure><ol><li>\"I Want To Tell You Everything\"</li><li>To Zanarkand</li><li>Prelude</li><li>Tidus' Theme</li><li>Otherworld</li><li>Hurry!!!</li><li>This is Your Story</li><li>Ominous</li><li>Normal Battle</li><li>Victory Fanfare</li><li>Game Over</li><li>Hopeless Desire</li><li>Underground Activities</li><li>Underwater Ruins</li><li>Al Bhed Tribe's Chi</li><li>Enemy Attack</li><li>Blitz Ball Gamblers</li><li>Besaid Island</li><li>The Sight Of Spira</li><li>Song of Prayer</li><li>Illusion</li><li>Between Ordeals</li><li>Song of Prayer (Valfor)</li><li>Summoned</li><li>Daughter of the Great Summoner Warrior</li><li>Good Night</li></ol><h3>Disc Two</h3><ol><li>Yuna's Theme</li><li>Sprouting</li><li>Farplane Sending</li><li>Silence Before the Storm</li><li>Song of Prayer (Ifrit)</li><li>Luca</li><li>Welcome the Old Maester Mika</li><li>Inflexible Determination</li><li>The Splendid Performance</li><li>Confrontation</li><li>Blitz Off</li><li>Auron's Theme</li><li>Mi'ihen Highway</li><li>Brass de Chocobo</li><li>Travel Company</li><li>Permitted Passage</li><li>Seymour's Theme</li><li>Twilight</li><li>Djose Temple</li><li>Song of Prayer (Ixion)</li><li>Riding Shoopuf</li><li>Rikku's Theme</li><li>Guadosalam</li></ol><h3>Disc Three</h3><ol><li>Thunder Plains</li><li>Jecht's Theme</li><li>Macalania Forest</li><li>Sea of Mists</li><li>The Temple Band</li><li>Seymour's Ambition</li><li>Song of Prayer (Shiva)</li><li>Pursuit</li><li>The Burning Sands</li><li>Peril</li><li>The Truth Revealed</li><li>Launch</li><li>Marriage Ceremony</li><li>Assault</li><li>Tragedy</li><li>I Can Fly</li><li>Via Purifico</li><li>Song of Prayer (Bahamut)</li><li>Moment of Truth</li><li>Patricide</li><li>Isn't It Beautiful?
